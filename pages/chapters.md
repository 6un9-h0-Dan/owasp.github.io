## OWASP Student Chapters Program
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has local chapters around the world that help teach, learn, and inspire application security. Our Student Chapters program helps to extend application security into colleges and universities worldwide. OWASP Student Chapters Program is a way to integrate passionate AppSec students. We want to create students chapters in order to organise events, meetings and have fun! If your school has a computer science or management information systems degree, we can help you Start a Student Chapter there.

View the OWASP Student Chapters Program information and a list of participating student groups.

## Start a Chapter
You don't need to be an expert in application security, just motivated to help build the OWASP community and organize meetings. There's a lot of help available from other Local Chapter leaders. So get your community moving to help the mission of software security awareness and start a local OWASP Chapter today!

A request to start or restart a chapter should be submitted by the founding member or group to the OWASP Chapter Request Form and should include:

List of the people that are founding the chapter and the geographical area to be covered by the new chapter,
Brief description of professional background or resume (from each of the founding leaders),
Statement of why he or she wants to be an OWASP Leader (from each of the founding leaders).
Each founding leader(s) (as well as any leaders joining the chapter after its creation) must read, understand, and agree to the terms of the Chapter Leader Handbook.
Generally speaking, the Chapter Leader Handbook asks that you:
* Will commit to organizing at least quarterly meetings
* Will find a stable location for meetings
* Will find great speakers
* Will publicize the chapter and recruit new members
* Will keep the chapter non-commercial
What is the process once I submit my request to start a chapter?

Once submitted, the request will be reviewed and approved by the OWASP Staff. Once the new chapter is approved

1. A chapter wiki page and mailing list will be set up for the new leader(s).

2. The chapter leader(s) will be given an owasp email account and password to operate as the administrator of the new chapter mailing list.

## Update Chapter Leader
You may also use the OWASP Chapter Request Form to modify or add new chapter leaders. The chapter wiki page and OWASP Foundation records must be updated for leaders to access benefits. This form ensures that our internal records will be up to date.

## Bring Speakers to Your Chapter
To support Local Chapter meetings and (web application) security conferences we started a travel-support program for OWASP presenters. If you are interested in attracting an OWASP speaker to your event, have a look at OWASP on the Move!
