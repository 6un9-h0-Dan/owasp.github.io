At the October public Board meeting at AppSec Virtual, the Board voted on Honorary Membership and active Complimentary Membership reform, and these are now live.

For hardworking OWASP community leaders who have done amazing things for many years, you will finally have a chance of being recognized by the Foundation and your peers for being a true OWASP hero and upholder of our values and mission. For active leaders, you will be pleasantly surprised with a new option available to you.

## What is the problem we're trying to solve?

Typically, non-profits and charities, the expectation is that community leaders are members. OWASP is almost unique that we don't require membership to participate or make it mandatory for leaders.

Only 17% of OWASP leaders are members of any sort. The Board felt that many non-member leaders could not vote or become Board members, so they were effectively donating their time, but not able to influence the Foundation or our mission. At the September Face to Face meeting, the Board discussed various membership models, and decided to offer active leaders Complimentary leadership and reform Honorary Membership.

## Honorary Membership reform

The Honorary membership system, set down in our bylaws for many years, wasn't functional for a long time, and prevented worthy members from receiving well-deserved Honorary membership. Honorary membership was all but Complimentary membership for those who asked... a lot, and this diminishes the recognition and efforts of those who are truly deserving of Honorary Membership. This is unfair and unsustainable, and doesn't help our mission.

Honorary Membership will become a true award - awarded by the Board only a few times a year. Honorary Membership will grant Lifetime membership for extraordinary service to OWASP and our mission over a long period of time.

## Complimentary Membership reform

For Leaders who are finding it difficult in this pandemic to justify paid membership, or feel that they contribute a lot to OWASP already, Complimentary Membership is now available.

Complimentary Membership is now live, and to qualify, you must:

- **You must be discoverable**. We can only discover you in the same way that any new member or member of the public can - via our website. You must have an up to date project or chapter page, your details must be in the "leaders.md" file, and your page is linked to your Github project or Meetup page.
- **You must be one of the top 5 leaders in your project or chapter**. The current Honorary membership requirement of a minimum of six months' service as a leader is still a prerequisite.
- **Chapters must have an active Meetup group**. The OWASP Foundation provides each chapter with a free Meetup Pro group, and this is how we will discover if you held at least 4 meetings in the last 12 months. If you use Facebook events or another method to schedule events, you can continue to do so, but in addition to Meetup. Meetup is the only official meeting scheduling platform for the purposes of Complimentary Membership.
- **Projects must have an active GitHub project**. We will be using GitHub activity metrics to determine if you're active. Even if you're not a Github style project, please start using Github to log issues and publish releases.
- **You should have an OWASP.org email address**. All Leaders are eligible for a free OWASP.org email address, and we encourage you to use your OWASP.org email for all official project or chapter business, and respond to all communications within 7 days.

OWASP has around 290 chapters, 160 projects, and approximately 1,000 active project and chapter leaders. We cannot manually evaluate each and every leader to determine if they are eligible for Complimentary Membership. Therefore, this benefit must be automated, and automation can only work if you use our standard tools and platforms.

## How do I take up Complimentary leadership?

Simply [Renew or Join](https://owasp.org/membership/), and if you're eligible, a Complimentary option will be available to you. Note, other recently membership reforms also make it possible for regional discounts for individual (\$20), two year (\$35) and Lifetime membership (\$200), or our standard pricing of \$50, \$95 for two years, and \$500 for Lifetime membership will also be offered.

Complimentary Membership does not auto-renew. Please keep an eye on the calendar to keep continuous membership benefits, or even better, join as a paid member when you can do so.

## Do I need to take up Complimentary Leadership? I want to continue supporting the Foundation

No. We encourage all OWASP Leaders to continue supporting our not-for-profit mission by donating their skills, passion, time, and monetarily by becoming a financial member. We hope that Leaders will regularly motivate others to join, sponsor, or donate to OWASP to help our mission.

## I am a Lifetime member and a leader... WAT

As a Lifetime member, I feel you.

We are working to improve the benefits offered to Lifetime members. We are creating an Awards and Scholarships policy that will govern the transparent, fair, and equitable access to training and conferences at our events. We will be encouraging committees and event organizers to extend previously available leadership benefits to Lifetime members as a priority. Hang in there, more news on that soon.

## What happens to other leadership benefits?

As all active Leaders are now eligible for a \$50 per year benefit, we will be replacing the "free" conference benefit with a far fairer and more transparent Awards and Scholarships policy. This will open up our mission to deserving and under-served groups, as well as better target benefits, and ensure that we know how much a particular Award or Scholarship will cost the event, trainer, or Foundation.

Most other leadership benefits will not change, but we will be constantly looking to improve them over time.
