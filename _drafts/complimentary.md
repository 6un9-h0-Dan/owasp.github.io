title: Announcing Active Leader Complimentary Membership
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

At the recent OWASP Global Board of Directors Face to Face sessions, the Board decided to tackle leadership benefits reform. At the moment, the expectation is that leaders are members, but only 17% of OWASP leaders are members of any sort. The Board will be considering a motion at the next Board meeting to offer Complimentary Membership to any active project or chapter leader. 

NB: At the time of writing, Complimentary Membership is not yet approved and may be varied from what is described here, particularly the details around the automation. We are providing this early access information to spread out the load on our staff in preparing for Complimentary Membership, and helping you prep to maximize your chances of being eligible through self-service.

Some leaders will need to take action to become Complimentary members. Depending on how long you've been using our standard tools or platforms will determine how soon you might be eligible for Complimentary Membership. Our goal is to reward active leaders with a highly valuable, low friction leadership benefit, while also benefiting new and existing members and the general public. 

OWASP has around 290 chapters, 160 projects, and approximately 1,000 active project and chapter leaders. We cannot manually evaluate each and every leader to determine if they are eligible for Complimentary Membership. Therefore, this benefit must be automated, and automation can only work if you use our standard tools and platforms. 

We are still working out the details of the automation to make it as easy and fast as possible, which means that you can help us out by preparing for the change:

* **You must be discoverable**. We can only discover you in the same way that any new member or member of the public can - via our website. You must have an up to date project or chapter page, your details must be in the "leaders.md" file, and your page is linked to your Github project or Meetup page. 
* **You must be one of the top 5 leaders in your project or chapter**. The current Honorary membership requirement of a minimum of six months' service as a leader is still a prerequisite.
* **Chapters must have an active Meetup group**. The OWASP Foundation provides each chapter with a free Meetup Pro group, and this is how we will discover if you held at least 4 meetings in the last 12 months. If you use Facebook events or another method to schedule events, you can continue to do so, but in addition to Meetup. Meetup is the only official meeting scheduling platform for the purposes of Complimentary Membership.
* **Projects must have an active GitHub project**. We will be using GitHub activity metrics to determine if you're active. Even if you're not a Github style project, please start using Github to log issues and publish releases. 
* **You should have an OWASP.org email address**. Leaders are already eligible for a free OWASP.org email address, which will eventually become a prerequisite for Complimentary Membership. You should use your OWASP.org email for all official project or chapter business. 

At this moment, we are still working on automation, and our feeling is that there will be an option on the Membership sign up page to check if you're eligible for Complimentary Membership using the criteria above, or a separate sign up page for leaders. We will communicate exactly how it will work with OWASP Leaders after the motion has passed and the automation is available. We expect this to happen no later than the end of the year. If we can determine that you've been an active leader as of November 1, 2020, the likely motion go live date, we will backdate your Complimentary Membership to November 1, 2020. 

## FAQ

**Q. Do I need to take up Complimentary Leadership? I want to continue supporting the Foundation, or I am a Lifetime member.**

A. You do not need to take up Complimentary Membership if you are already a Lifetime member or a leader who believes in supporting OWASP financially. We will be working on improving the value of Lifetime and paid Membership in response to this change. 

**Q. What happens to Honorary Membership?**

A. If this change is approved, the Board will still be able to grant Honorary Membership to recognize long-standing, selfless, and extraordinary efforts on behalf of the OWASP Foundation. Honorary Membership will become more of an award to amazing contributors than merely "free" Membership, as done in the past. 

**Q. What are we doing to avoid abuse of Complimentary Leadership**

A. To get the process up and running, it's likely automation checks may be a bit simple at launch. We'd like to err on a "trust but verify" basis to speed up implementation. However, we reserve the right to strip leadership and revoke membership if we discover abuse, as this is contrary to our Code of Conduct. 

## Call to Action

It's time for OWASP Leaders to get ready for Complimentary Membership! Luckily, the prerequisites required for Complimentary Leadership automation helps members, new members, and the general public find your project or your chapter, so a win-win for everyone. 

* Update your owasp.org project or chapter page. It should provide helpful information about your project or chapter for new members or members of the public. Please maintain this page at least a few times a year. 
* Ensure the top 5 leaders in your leaders.md file are accurate. You must be in one of the top 5 positions for at least six months to qualify. 
* If you are a chapter, you must have a Meetup group under the OWASP Foundation. If you don't have one, or wish to migrate your group to the Foundation so you don't have to pay any more fees, please use Contact Us. Active chapters are defined by four meetings in the last 12 months. 
* If you are a project, you must have a Github project under the OWASP Foundation GitHub. If you need to migrate or mirror your project to the OWASP Foundation, please submit a ticket via the Contact Us form. Projects can continue to use their existing repos, but our automation must be able to discover it, which is why we offer the mirror option.  
* Regularly log in to your OWASP.org email and make sure it's listed in the leaders.md file. For any leaders who don't yet have one, submit a ticket to obtain your OWASP.org email address.

You can submit tickets at the [Contact Us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/create/72) button on the OWASP website to claim your project or chapter webpages, create a Meetup Group within the Foundation organization, mirror your project, migrate or create a GitHub project within the OWASP Foundation, or to obtain an OWASP.org email address.

I hope as many leaders as possible are able to take up Complimentary Leadership once it is available. We need our Leaders to be Members, and this initiative by the Board will help that.
