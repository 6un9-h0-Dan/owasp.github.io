title: "OWASP, our community, and vendors: a healthy and vendor neutral approach"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

Our community should have the expectation that we will always be vendor neutral, but this doesn't mean no vendors and no advertising. Mnay of us work or have worked for vendors, and OWASP needs vendors to thrive, and our community needs a healthy relationship with vendors to financially support OWASP's mission, projects, and chapters. That means setting expectations for both our community and vendors alike, and staying true to that vision and expectations.

Recently, as a member benefit, we announced the global availability of [Secure Flag](https://secureflag.owasp.org), which has an [open source OWASP project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secureflag-open-platform/), as well as a commercial version. Secure Flag Ltd is hosting the full Enterprise version for OWASP members. Allowing a commercial product as a member benefit brought up some healthy discussion as to OWASP's prime directive on vendor neutrality. The way I see vendor neutrality is simple:

> OWASP is vendor neutral, which doesn't mean *no vendors*, it means non-exclusive fair and reasonable terms for a level playing field for *all* vendors.

Any vendor who wishes to participate in the OWASP Learning Platform can easily do so. We will be constantly adding to the Learning Platform and many other member benefits. I encourage all open source projects and vendors to work with us, especially if you've had a rough time in the past.

## OWASP is vendor neutral

OWASP is renowned for being vendor neutral. It's a key part of our four core values:

- Open: Everything at OWASP is radically transparent from our finances to our code.
- Innovative: We encourage and support innovation and experiments for solutions to software security challenges.
- Global: Anyone around the world is encouraged to participate in the OWASP community.
- Integrity: Our community is respectful, supportive, truthful, and **vendor neutral**

That doesn't mean we are vendor hostile, no vendors allowed, no vendor germs, or anything like that. Our community has historically had a rough relationship with vendors, I think because they had the wrong expectations. At times, it's been difficult for vendors to work with OWASP, because in most ways, as a community, we are absolutely every appsec vendor's desired and qualified target market, but then our community dislikes certain marketing and promotional behaviors and things have gone south from there.

So I will make it clear now that I will never sign a vendor exclusive contract, or one that locks out other vendors. We will be clarifying the rules around vendor captured projects and chapters, as they are clearly against our core mission, but that doesn't mean there is no role for vendors in projects or chapters. There absolutely is. Let's go through some use cases.

## Specific use cases

### Corporate supporters and sponsors

If you are a corporate member, supporter, or sponsor of an event, OWASP should be friendly, welcoming, and easy to deal with. I know this hasn't always been true, but it's important for our community and vendors to get along by having the same expectations regarding vendor neutrality and the way in which our community engages with vendors. I would encourage you to reach out to me or Kelly Santalucia if you're had issues in the past, or you think the OWASP Foundation is not being vendor neutral. I've already had meetings with a few vendors, and I'm happy to take more.

One of the easiest ways to get involved with us is to become a corporate supporter, and we have startup pricing, regional pricing, and regular pricing, as well as monthly, and quarterly payment options to make it easier than ever to be a part of our community. I will be starting a Corporate Advisory Committee shortly, and encourage any of our existing corporate supporters to join that committee to help OWASP improve our commercial relationships and value.

Please join here:

We also welcome bartering partnerships, and I want to recognize otherwise high value bartering as full corporate sponsors. Please work with Kelly Santalucia in relation to bartering to obtain your corporate supporter benefits.

### Partnerships

I have signed a number of partnerships for the common good of OWASP and our members and community, of which Secure Flag is just one. I am actively pursuing partnerships as we go along. If you have an offer for our members, such as discounts to your events, products, or even like Secure Flag, a complete app or platform we can offer to our members, please set up an appointment with me:

### Speakers working for a vendor

If a chapter, event, or training requires a standard template to be used, please use it. I have approved exemptions to use our standard first and last slides, so there's some continuity in thumbnails, and then left you to your own devices. I know some folks have extensive slides, and reformatting them for just one event doesn't make sense, but please work with us on templates to avoid issues with vendor pitches / marketing.

We strongly discourage marketing when speaking at our events. Our members are usually keen to have hands on time with your product or service, so it's best to demonstrate your product or service as an online hands on environment, and take questions, don't just talk at the audience. We will be offering opportunities like this throughout 2021 as an experiment, in the form of a set of lightning labs.

Doing the standard marketing pitch or spiel just doesn't work and please don't do that. This is almost certainly the main reason I think our community gets a bit of a bad reputation for being vendor hostile, but it's also encumbent on speakers spruiking a product or service to address our highly technical market a LOT differently than a typical marketing push.

### Training providers

We will be running a lot of virtual training events in 2021 and obviously once we go back to in person events, these have been highly profitable for both OWASP and training providers. I want to work with training providers to address splits if the training provider is doing all or most of the production, but we can also bring you a lot of clients, so we need to work that out.

If you are regularly performing commercial training that deals with OWASP topics, please be aware that we have registered trademarks, and you should read the trademark section below.

### Shared Member and back of house services

Shared services for members, such as Secure Flag, are designed to maximize member benefits and minimize costs to the Foundation. None of these shared services have an exclusive contract with us. I will never sign such a thing. If you are a vendor and want to offer our members your service, even if we have one very similar, we will work with you to get you into our learning platform. This goes doubly for our own projects. I would love to host a community SKF instance, as well as any other of our leading projects or platforms that could be used by our members. Please contact me or Harold Blankenship for more details.

We use a number of shared services that help run OWASP, notably Google, GitHub, Meetup, Stripe, and Zoom. I have been eliminating duplicates for COVID funding purposes, which might seem anti-vendor neutral, but it's simply that we need to have a platform to do what we do. I am working on moving away some of the more proprietary cloud services to open source alternatives, such as replacing Meetup, which is both extremely expensive, but also highly restrictive. As an open source community, we need to invest in the open source community, similar to my statement on SKF above. We need to live and breathe open source whereever we can. If you can assist with this, please contact Harold Blankship.

## Trademarks and fair use

OWASP&reg; has several registered trademarks, and to keep them, we must enforce their fair use. Folks can always use OWASP in reference to us as fair use, but when the use becomes a regular commercial endeavor or line of business, we will be working with folks to become either a licensee of our trademarks, or preferably joining as a corporate member. Corporate members will have a license to use OWASP&reg; in their marketing materials and commercial purposes for as long as they are members and they don't imply that OWASP supports or warrants their product or service.

OWASP Projects and Chapters are not their own legal entities, but the major lifeblood of OWASP. As such, any official OWASP project, chapter, event, committee, or meeting is always free to use our name in their project, chapter name, marketing, and any merchandise or materials they produce. OWASP members are free to promote OWASP as they see fit, but if they are regularly using our trademarks for commercial purposes, they should become a corporate member.

We have not worked out the full details of the trademark licensing program as yet. I would love to have security consulting firms, large enterprises, and those using our marks for commercial training to discuss with us how best to make this work for us and them. I am loathe to become litigious over this, and I like the [Linux Foundation's approach](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage/) to their trademarks, but just like the Linux Foundation, Mozilla, and Gnome Foundation, we also have a duty to protect OWASP's marks. I would prefer a consistent approach amongst many open source communities to this difficult topic, especially as OWASP is very late to registered trademarks compared to its nearly 20 year history.
