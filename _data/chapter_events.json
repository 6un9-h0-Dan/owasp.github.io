By the time controls are put in place to thwart the technical IOCs, attackers change it and counter with new attacks. So, it becomes essential for defenders to continuously automate the Threat Intelligence actioning and harness the tactical information as well used by attackers and have countermeasures in place.</p> <p>By automating Threat Intel collection, analysis, and dissemination, we can deduce predictive intelligence providing greater visibility to the organizations while allowing them to anticipate and counter threats even before they attack. We will discuss how end-to-end threat intelligence automation in a closed trusted sharing environment could be used to operationalize actionable and relevant predictive intelligence by correlating, enriching, and analyzing threat data collected in real-time from a wide range of external and internal sources over a hub and spoke sharing model. We will also cover advanced automation strategies for the full threat intelligence lifecycle while detailing how mutual threat sightings could be used to identify and prioritize threats with precision confidence.</p> <p>High Level Agenda for Presentation</p> <p>Collective Defense Vs Passive Defense Vs Active Defense</p> <p>Threat Intelligence and Its types</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Operationalisation</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Automation / Orchestration</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Collaboration</p> <p>Collective Defense</p> <p>Takeaways</p> <p>---<br/>Short bio :<br/>Avkash K<br/>VP - Research and Innovation at Cyware Labs</p> <p>Information Security professional with overall 12+ years of experience in Information Security domain.

Red team has been used as a general term for all areas of offensive security just as blue team for defensive security. True red teaming goes Beyond Pentesting and into more adversarial emulation. While there are overlapping skills, there are differences that will be discussed as Phillip shares his experience of going from a pentester to a red teamer. In this talk, you will learn about the different areas that make up red team operations, common tools, and the path to becoming a red teamer. In this presentation, you will learn about resources helpful for a path into red teaming.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Phillip Wylie is a Lead Curriculum Developer at Point3 Federal, Adjunct Instructor at Dallas College (formerly Richland College), and The Pwn School Project founder.
