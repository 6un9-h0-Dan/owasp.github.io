What's attacking known vulnerabilities on open-source code? Are you able to tie vulnerability and attack data to help prioritize your risk? Why do some applications have certain vulnerabilities and others don't? Join David Lindner, CISO, at Contrast Security as he reviews the latest in AppSec vulnerability and attack trends spelled out in the Contrast Labs Bimonthly and Yearly AppSec Intelligence Reports . In this talk, David will explain:</p> <p>- Vulnerabilities that are found in a subset of applications but absent in others</p> <p>- The numbers of attacks an application received on average</p> <p>- Prevalence of vulnerabilities versus the likelihood that they will be exploited</p> <p>- Meantime to Resolution (MTTR) in protected assets</p> <p>- A \"watch list\" of vulnerabilities that require special scrutiny</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>David is an experienced Application Security Professional with over 18 years of experience in the computer security industry. During this time, David has worked within multiple disciplines in the security field, from application development, network architecture design and support, IT security and consulting, security training, and application security. Over the past 10 years, David has specialized in all things related to mobile applications and securing them. David has supported many different clients including financial, government, automobile, healthcare, and retail. In his spare time, David is seen on the golf course or honing his mobile testing skills by participating in numerous bug bounties.</p> <p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlindner/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlindner/</a></p> <p>Twitter: @golfhackerdave</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>5:45pm: Introduction, Presentation &amp; Q&amp;A<br/>At end of meeting: Raffle (two $50 gift certificates sponsored by Contrast Security)</p> <p>Unlike our usual in-person meetings, this event is BYOB.

Dashcams create numerous artefacts of evidential value such as GPS data, temporal data, vehicular speed data, audio, video and photographic images. Dashcam usage has increased over the last few years with 9% of drivers using dashcams in 2015, 17% in 2017, and 27% in 2018 (Aviva, 2018). This number is expected to increase remarkably, particularly with some manufacturers planning to incorporate dashcam capability within new car design. Dashcam evidence is essential in road-traffic related incidents as well as to provide evidence of in-vehicle activity. Despite their importance, there is a paucity of research into dashcam forensics, and there are no known tools that enable dashcam forensics.</p> <p>This talk highlights the work that we are doing in supporting this field. The talk provides an overview of the evidential value of dashcam devices, methods of extracting the evidence, efforts to develop a useful dashcam evidence dataset, and then reports on three prototypes aimed at extracting dashcam evidence.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:15 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:30 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:45 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "}, {"chapter": "Cambridge", "repo": "www-chapter-cambridge", "name": "ARU CSNRG, OWASP Cambs & BCS Cybercrime SG \"The Shadowserver Foundation\" Webinar", "date": "2020-12-15", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cambridge-Meetup/events/274821801/", "timezone": "Europe/London", "description": "<p>ARU CSNRG, OWASP Cambridge &amp; BCS Cybercrime Forensics \" The Shadowserver Foundation, who we are, what we do and why we love doing it!\u201d\" Webinar</p> <p>Tuesday 15th December 18:00 \u2013 19:30 \u2013 Online</p> <p>Hosted by the Cyber Security &amp; Networking Research Group, Anglia Ruskin University, OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter &amp; BCS Cybercrime Forensics SG.</p> <p>Background</p> <p>OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software.
