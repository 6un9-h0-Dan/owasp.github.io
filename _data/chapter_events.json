We love Linux because it\u2019s so fast to build and deploy web apps, but the minute you want to put any kind of centralized security or control over that environment, you risk running DevOps into the ground.</p> <p>The fact is, we need DevOps to run fast and lean, but we also need a centralized way to manage access, secure cloud-based systems, and enforce security policies on cloud hosts, virtualized servers, and containers. In this session, we\u2019ll talk about moving from heavy-handed access control to lightweight, agile access guardrails that are built specifically for DevOps.</p> <p>Watch this presentation and learn how to implement:</p> <p>- Real-time user session monitoring for visibility and audit/compliance<br/>- Just-in-time access approvals and pre-execution blocks using 2FA or Slack/Teams<br/>- Threat detection and alerting for Linux based attack vectors<br/>- Identity-based policy for shared accounts and root-access users</p> <p>Presenter bio:</p> <p>Scott Holt</p> <p>Scott is a security professional with experience working at both Lookout and Rapid7 previously.

OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model</p> <p>From a startup to a multinational corporation the software development industry is currently dominated by agile frameworks and product teams and as part of it DevOps strategies.</p> <p>It has been observed that during implementation, security aspects can be missed. The OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which is presented in the talk, shows security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.</p> <p>In this session Timo will give an introduction and answer questions like when to use OWASP SAM and when and how to use DSOMM.</p> <p>OUR SPEAKER: Timo Pagel, DevSecOps Consultant</p> <p>Timo has been in the IT industry for over fifteen years.

It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle (<a href=\"http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/\" class=\"linkified\">http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/</a>), for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c (<a href=\"https://r2c.dev/\" class=\"linkified\">https://r2c.dev/</a>).</p> <p>Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.</p> <p>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Or find hardcoded credentials using the query:<br/>boto3.client(..., aws_secret_access_key=\u201d...\u201d, aws_access_key_id=\u201d...\u201d )</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep</a><br/>Test in your browser: <a href=\"https://semgrep.dev/\" class=\"linkified\">https://semgrep.dev/</a></p> <p>Speaker's Bio: Grayson Hardaway is a security researcher at r2c, a startup working on static analysis tools purpose-built for the modern workflow. At r2c, Grayson authors static analysis tailored for finding security vulnerabilities in open source code. Previously, Grayson worked for the US Department of Defense fuzzing and exploiting obscure protocols. When not submitting patches, Grayson is hefting a heavy pack uphill, crafting guitar solos, or learning something new: currently woodworking.</p> <p>***Networking Session***<br/>After the talk, OWASP chapter members and interested parties can linger for virtual networking.... to catch up on recent COVID-19-related issues, working-from-home experiences, job situations, our next meeting date, etc.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Northern Virginia", "repo": "www-chapter-northern-virginia", "name": "AppSec, DevSecOps, and IoT - Oh My!", "date": "2020-08-20", "time": "18:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Northern-Virginia-Chapter/events/272348331/", "timezone": "US/Eastern", "description": "<p>Abstract: It doesn't take much to realize that the world of IoT has exploded. How many now have a Ring doorbell and are using Alexa to control their homes? Sensors, indicators and trackers are everywhere and many times we are not even aware of it. But in a world where there is an ever-increasing threat landscape and more attacks then ever, where does security fit in? How do we balance convenience, speed and data integrity? And when we realize that behind every device is an application that will process that data and then communicate to another application, how do we ensure that those applications are secure? This is why Application Security and DevSecOps are so important in this space and make all the difference between success and failure.</p> <p>Bio: Rob is currently a Global Application Security Sales Evangelist for HCL providing thought leadership for the application security space, particularly as it relates to DevOps and DevSecOps initiatives.
