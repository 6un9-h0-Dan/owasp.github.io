Is: \u201cHow do I get started in bug bounties\u201d So In this presentation, I'm going to guide you and share my personal experiences on how you can get started in hunting for security bugs. We are going to dig into what tools and skills you need, what to expect, and how to avoid hunters burnout. All while trying to iron out misconceptions and avoiding common pitfalls.

The presentation is based on a TEDex talk of Ernesto Sirolli where he talks about his experiences as aid-work volunteer in the 70s and what he learned from it.</p> <p>Where he commented on a failure as \"at least we fed the hippos\".</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>The security community is trying to solve insecurity caused by bugs and flaws in software for many years now, but with what success?<br/>We almost never look at successes and failures experiences in other areas, but we could really learn from them. This talk is inspired by Ernesto Sirolli\u2019s TED talk \u201cWant to help someone? Shut up and listen!\u201d about failures in aid programs around the world. Listening to Ernesto Sirolli, you cannot miss the similarity with the security community trying to tell developers how to write secure code. This talk points out common failures of the security community when communicating with developers, trying to solve their problems without understanding what their problems really are.<br/>Using the hippo-analogy for resource wasted and security failures. During the talks, those \u2018(in-)secure hippos\u2019 are identified, advice on how to avoid them are provided, by anecdotes and best practices from the perience of the past 15 years in the security field of information / application security.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Martin Knobloch, Global AppSec Strategist at Micro Focus, is a long-time information security leader with more than 15 years of experience in the field.

Simply put if Cyber is in the business of Revenue Protection, then we need to have a defense in depth plan to combat the biggest threats to our companies. This matrix allows a company to overlay their major threats with the NIST Cyber Security Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, &amp; Recover) to build a robust security plan. Organizations which perform this activity will gain a better understanding of how to protect their company as they fill in safeguards which mitigate important threats. Remember the devil is in the details, hence why we chose a TaSManian Devil as the project logo.</p> <p>Ross Young is the CISO of Caterpillar Financial, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, and a SANS instructor. Prior to this role, he was a divisional CISO at Capital One. His expertise ranges from attacking financial services for the federal government to defending organizations by automating defenses in DevSecOps pipelines. He is actively involved in all things cloud, container, and Kubernetes security. Ross holds master's and bachelor's degrees from Johns Hopkins University, Idaho State University, and Utah State University. Ross's interest in pirates and ninjas have inspired him to stealthily enable and safeguard the business without the paperwork.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Triangle Nc", "repo": "www-chapter-triangle-nc", "name": "Speaker TBA - Contact us if interested", "date": "2021-03-25", "time": "18:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/owasptriangle/events/lckdnqyccfbhc/", "timezone": "US/Eastern", "description": "<p>TBA</p> "}, {"chapter": "Bangalore", "repo": "www-chapter-bangalore", "name": "Moving to a different Meetup Group", "date": "2021-02-28", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Bangalore-Chapter/events/276065123/", "timezone": "Asia/Calcutta", "description": "<p>Hi Team,</p> <p>We are moving to a different meet-up group by 28th <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/bangalore-owasp-meetup-group\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/bangalore-owasp-meetup-group</a></p> "}, {"chapter": "London", "repo": "www-chapter-london", "name": "OWASP London [ONLINE] Chapter Meeting", "date": "2021-03-04", "time": "18:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-London/events/276528857/", "timezone": "Europe/London", "description": "<p>The next OWASP London Chapter Meeting will be online.

In her videos, she attempts to bridge the gap between \"I know what bug bounties are\" and \"bug bounty hunter\" giving advice specifically tailored to bug hunting. She's now produced over 50 videos on bug bounty hunting for an audience of over 25,000 YouTube subscribers. Aimed at a beginner audience these go from finding your first bug, to how to use specific tools, to how to find specific bug classes.<br/>Katie has discovered and responsibly reported security vulnerabilities to several large organisations such as Verizon Media and the US Department of Defense</p> "}, {"chapter": "Norway", "repo": "www-chapter-norway", "name": "Google's Differential Privacy Library \u2013 Mirac Vuslat Basaran (Google)", "date": "2021-03-17", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Norway/events/276469937/", "timezone": "Europe/Oslo", "description": "<p>Differential privacy helps organizations derive insights from data while simultaneously ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or re-identified.

Traditionally OWASP runs several conferences a year, but with the pandemic, we've switched to virtual events with mixed success.</p> <p>We also have some housekeeping items to do. As you may know, I was elected to the OWASP Global Board of Directors and am serving as the Secretary for 2021. In addition, I also volunteer as the Nashua Chapter Leader, and I am on the 2021 Training Planning Committee, and I am on the Compliance Committee, and I am on the Trademark Board Committee, and I am on the Policy Review Committee.</p> <p>That's a lot of volunteering and I need some help.</p> <p>Chapters are now required to have at least two leaders, so I need at least one more of you to step up as a chapter leader for Nashua (we can have a max of five I believe). The role entails setting up meetings and finding speakers for them. Pretty easy stuff! As a Chapter Leader, you'll get discounts on OWASP events. If I can't get one more person to volunteer as a Chapter Leader, then OWASP will shut down our chapter.</p> <p>Next, for OWASP global events, we are always looking for reviewers of submissions. We get people who want to give talks and trainings at our events and as a reviewer, you would be asked to read their proposal and score it. It takes roughly 10 minutes per submission. In return, you get a discount on the event. Drop me a line if you're interested in doing this in the future and I'll add you to the list.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing all of you, and especially those of you that have recently joined.</p> <p>You can reach out to me directly with any questions: bil.corry@owasp.org</p> <p>Best regards,</p> <p>- Bil</p> "}]
