While we\u2019ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams.<br/>Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company\u2019s security bar.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another way.</p> <p>Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (\u201cguard rails\u201d) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.</p> <p>In this talk, we\u2019ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:</p> <p>Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on<br/>- How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes<br/>- How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that\u2019s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers<br/>- How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</p> <p>Speaker<br/>Grayson Hardaway is a security researcher at r2c, a startup working on static analysis tools purpose-built for the modern workflow.

Keep reading to learn more...</p> <p>THE TALKS</p> <p>TALK 1 : DISCOUNT PHISH BURN BETTER</p> <p>- Did my e-mail provider detect my malicious intent?</p> <p>- Was there an e-mail gateway that saw my malware?</p> <p>- Did it land in the junk/spam folder?</p> <p>- Has the victim even seen it or read it yet?</p> <p>- Did he/she click the link or did it seem suspicious?</p> <p>- Did the malware download properly?</p> <p>- Was it analysed in a sandbox?</p> <p>- Did the Anti-Virus detect it? What about EDR?</p> <p>- Maybe the SOC is torturing my malware in a lab environment right now?</p> <p>- Maybe it executed fine, but just stopped working due to a bug?</p> <p>- Was the outbound C2 traffic blocked or even worse, detected?</p> <p>Have you ever asked yourself one of the above questions, or just wonder how life is as an attacker seeking to conduct a successful (spear) phishing campaign? \"Discount Phish Burn Better\" is a talk about how an attacker can improve his odds of successfully phishing a victim by reducing the cost of payload/malware development.</p> <p>TALK 2 : USER MODE API HOOKS AND BYPASSES</p> <p>- Can I upload my tools to the compromised workstation without being detected or do I have to stay in-memory?</p> <p>- Will the EDR detect if I use process injection to migrate to e.g. explorer.exe?</p> <p>- Can I dump LSASS and steal NTLM hashes?</p> <p>- Can I backdoor an application, e.g. Citrix Receiver to escalate privileges when another user logs in?</p> <p>\u00a0<br/>On-host security products such as Anti-Virus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products aim to have sufficient surveillance of the host to ensure that attackers can't operate without being detected. One of the techniques such products use is known as Win32 API hooking in user mode. However, as the user-mode component of APIs are loaded and owned by the current process, the process itself can inspect, overwrite or simply just not use them and use its own implementation of the API functionality, to avoid messing with the hooks altogether. This talk will give an introduction to Win32 APIs, modules, API hooks and different bypass techniques that may be essential to avoiding detection.</p> <p>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?<br/>The event is open for everyone - but it is highly technical.</p> <p>Photo: Blake Connally, Unsplash.com</p> "}, {"chapter": "Copenhagen", "repo": "www-chapter-copenhagen", "name": "Workshop: Elastic SIEM (4 hr) (NEW DATE WILL BE FINAL 1ST WEEK OF MARCH)", "date": "2021-03-20", "time": "12:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Copenhagen-Chapter/events/276244555/", "timezone": "Europe/Copenhagen", "description": "<p>NEW DATE WILL BE FINALLY DECIDED IN THE WEEK FIRST WEEK OF MARCH</p> <p>This time around OWASP Copenhagen will host a free 4hr workshop on Elastic SIEM courtesy of David Thejl-Clayton - SOC leader of JN Data.</p> <p>The workshop is designed to get you started using it and provide you with hands-on experience with that along with MISP and TheHive, two accompaning tools which, just as Elastic, are free to use.</p> <p>Everything will be held virtually.

Later in March Julia Ganol will tell her experiences as a real security champion. Alexander, Davide, P\u00e9ter and Timur will reflect on the main speakers interactively.</p> <p>So we start with Marcos who explains the upcoming version 2.0 of the Security Champions Playbook project by bringing new ideas when going through the 6-steps approach for implementing the program. From myths and pitfalls to training and continuous engagement strategies.</p> <p>According to OWASP definition, Security Champions are \"active members of a team that may help to make decisions about when to engage the Security Team\". They act as a core element of the security assurance process within the product or service, and hold the role of the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) within the team.</p> <p>The Security Champions Playbook describes the main steps for fast establishment of a Security Champions program regardless of the company size and maturity of the existing security processes. It is currently organized in the following steps:<br/>1. Identify teams<br/>2. Define the role<br/>3. Nominate Champions<br/>4. Set up communication channels<br/>5. Build solid knowledge base<br/>6. Maintain interest</p> <p>### Speakers</p> <p>The main speaker of the day Marcos Valle is a security engineer at Glovo, a fast-paced unicorn in the delivery segment. At Glovo, he leads the Product Security vertical and the Security Champions program. He is also responsible for implementing the secure CI/CD pipeline, managing vulnerabilities and fostering a company-wide security-by-design culture. Previously, he worked for several years in the military, mostly as a penetration tester for governmental partners. He currently lives in sunny Barcelona and is always up for talking about security, coding or just having a chilled conversation over some tapas.</p> <p>### Moderated by</p> <p>Timur Khrotko and P\u00e9ter Nyilasy on behalf of OWASP HU</p> <p>### Meat links</p> <p>\"Security Champions v2.0\", a 2017 talk by Alexander Antukh:<br/><a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Bucharest_2017_Antukh.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Bucharest_2017_Antukh.pdf</a></p> <p>Security Champions Playbook v1.1, a project:<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook</a></p> <p>\"Software security at the organizational level\", an article by P\u00e9ter Nyilasy:<br/><a href=\"https://medium.com/defdeveu/software-security-at-the-organizational-level-980174615443\" class=\"linkified\">https://medium.com/defdeveu/software-security-at-the-organizational-level-980174615443</a></p> <p>\"Organizational glue (OD approach to the champs dilemma)\" a Global AppSec 2020 talk by P\u00e9ter Nyilasy w/ Timur Khrotko:<br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OsHNYG8uciM\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/OsHNYG8uciM</a></p> <p>### Credits<br/>Photo by Karsten Winegeart on Unsplash</p> "}, {"chapter": "Norway", "repo": "www-chapter-norway", "name": "Google's Differential Privacy Library \u2013 Mirac Vuslat Basaran (Google)", "date": "2021-03-17", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Norway/events/276469937/", "timezone": "Europe/Oslo", "description": "<p>Differential privacy helps organizations derive insights from data while simultaneously ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or re-identified.

In order to successfully respond to Security incidents we needed a centralized platform which aggregates all the data about our premises in a single place.</p> <p>Surface Security (Security Intelligence Automation Platform) is an internally built tool which assists our internal Security teams to gain a holistic view about our externally exposed assets. More than that, it facilitates faster incident response based on the information correlated by it. Surface started as a small project in which we tried to close the gaps identified in our security controls. The platform's core is built in Django which is a Python-based open-source framework which has a fast learning curve. Besides Django, we're using technologies like Ansible (automation), Dkron (fault-tolerant jobs), Elasticsearch (Security metrics storage) and Grafana (reporting). During the whole period it gained a lot of traction in our company determining people to contribute to its success by implementing and suggesting new features. We're currently utilizing it for reporting the Security gaps to other areas of key business areas and for Security controls like: monitoring our externally exposed assets, vulnerability management, security incidents, bug bounty reports and penetration testing.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>I'm focused on Application Security Engineering &amp; Penetration Testing combined with CAMS mindset (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing - DevSecOps) and I reported security bugs to Google, Facebook, Uber, Bitdefender, ING Bank, Yahoo or other companies. One of the most interesting thing is that I built a platform \"Surface - Security Intelligence Automation Platform\" which is being used by more than 900 people in Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter and I was the Security SME for a Private Cloud based on OpenStack with environments as code.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep<br/>We\u2019ll discuss a program analysis tool we\u2019re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c. Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.<br/>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Bence Nagy is a software engineer at r2c, working on Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.dev web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic\u2019s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019.

It can be used in malware obfuscation engines which are used to secure digital rights management against hackers, and bypass anti-malware programs. In the real world scenarios, there are some constraints that should be considered during malware obfuscation. Using deep learning can help to select the best samples which are satisfying these constraints. In this presentation, we will show how can we use deep learning techniques to improve the performance of obfuscator engines against malware detection techniques.</p> <p>Talk 2: Adversarial machine learning (AML)<br/>Speakers: Dr. Sorcha Healy Principal Engineer, Lead Data Scientist at McAfee and Dr. Catherine Huang - Principal Engineer and Senior Staff Data Scientist at McAfee</p> <p>In this talk Sorcha and Catherine will review the general attack landscape against ML and ML security providers. Understanding the fundamentals behind what a machine learning model does and how it works in combination with the Mitre Adversarial Matrix can provide some sensible MLOps practices to protect the components of a ML system. We will review adversarial machine learning (AML) use cases and demonstrate McAfee\u2019s applied research in AML in protecting our customers against this hostile landscape.</p> "}]
