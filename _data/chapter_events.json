This talk is inspired by Ernesto Sirolli\u2019s TED talk \u201cWant to help someone? Shut up and listen!\u201d about failures in aid programs around the world. Listening to Ernesto Sirolli, you cannot miss the similarity with the security community trying to tell developers how to write secure code. This talk points out common failures of the security community when communicating with developers, trying to solve their problems without understanding what their problems really are.<br/>Using the hippo-analogy for resource wasted and security failures. During the talks, those \u2018(in-)secure hippos\u2019 are identified, advice on how to avoid them are provided, by anecdotes and best practices from the perience of the past 15 years in the security field of information / application security.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Martin Knobloch, Global AppSec Strategist at Micro Focus, is a long-time information security leader with more than 15 years of experience in the field.

While integrating security into CI/CD offers many benefits, it is critical to understand that a full SSA program encompasses a variety of activities \u2013 many of which are incompatible with run time restrictions and other constraints imposed by these pipelines. This webinar looks at the breadth of activities involved in a mature SSA program and steps through the aspects of a program that can be realistically included in a pipeline, as well as those that cannot.

Simply put if Cyber is in the business of Revenue Protection, then we need to have a defense in depth plan to combat the biggest threats to our companies. This matrix allows a company to overlay their major threats with the NIST Cyber Security Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, &amp; Recover) to build a robust security plan. Organizations which perform this activity will gain a better understanding of how to protect their company as they fill in safeguards which mitigate important threats. Remember the devil is in the details, hence why we chose a TaSManian Devil as the project logo.</p> <p>Ross Young is the CISO of Caterpillar Financial, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, and a SANS instructor.

He is actively involved in all things cloud, container, and Kubernetes security. Ross holds master's and bachelor's degrees from Johns Hopkins University, Idaho State University, and Utah State University.

Careers are radically changing due to the pandemic and we need to adapt. Some industries and companies are thriving; others are on the decline.

The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.</p> <p>The BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.</p> <p>Speaker Biographies &amp; Abstracts</p> <p>Dr Tim French FBCS FRSA MIET, Teaching Fellow Cyber Sec, Inst of Coding , Dept Computer Science, University of Bath. \"Cyber Sec in Connected Cars: a \u201cGreen field\u201d opportunity or<br/>\u201cold Wine in new Bottles\"? - It\u2019s all a question of Trust!\u201d</p> <p>Bio: Dr Tim French FBCS FRSA MIET, Teaching Fellow Cyber Sec, Inst of Coding , Dept Computer Science, University of Bath.</p> <p>Time was previously a Research &amp; Development Cyber Sec Senior Systems Engineer &amp; Cyber lead for a Global OEM.

The aim is to provide a brief \"insider\" insight (from a global OEM oriented perspective) of a complex and rapidly evolving domain. Given the ever-widening adversarial attack surface, OEM\u2019s, regulators, and governments must establish priorities. But, from an OEMs perspective any c/m must also retain profit margins in a highly competitive industry.</p> <p>Relay attack, LiDar \"blinding\" , V2X , back end, End2end, Infotainment, ...where should cyber resilience efforts be best focussed and by whom?</p> <p>After briefly reviewing the automotive cyber regulatory landscape, and examining some key vulnerabilities, exploits and counter-measures it is suggested that only by seeking to promote multiple stakeholder cooperation by OEM\u2019s, Thatcham, DoT &amp; regulators (i.e. seeing the bigger picture, avoiding silos) can ensure that the modern connected car, AVs &amp; associated 'Smart City' Eco-systems, offer intrinsically safer, more resilient vehicles.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>17:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>17:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>18:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> <p>(Please register on the link provided)</p> "}, {"chapter": "Norway", "repo": "www-chapter-norway", "name": "Google's Differential Privacy Library \u2013 Mirac Vuslat Basaran (Google)", "date": "2021-03-17", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Norway/events/276469937/", "timezone": "Europe/Oslo", "description": "<p>Differential privacy helps organizations derive insights from data while simultaneously ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or re-identified.

Traditionally OWASP runs several conferences a year, but with the pandemic, we've switched to virtual events with mixed success.</p> <p>We also have some housekeeping items to do. As you may know, I was elected to the OWASP Global Board of Directors and am serving as the Secretary for 2021. In addition, I also volunteer as the Nashua Chapter Leader, and I am on the 2021 Training Planning Committee, and I am on the Compliance Committee, and I am on the Trademark Board Committee, and I am on the Policy Review Committee.</p> <p>That's a lot of volunteering and I need some help.</p> <p>Chapters are now required to have at least two leaders, so I need at least one more of you to step up as a chapter leader for Nashua (we can have a max of five I believe). The role entails setting up meetings and finding speakers for them. Pretty easy stuff! As a Chapter Leader, you'll get discounts on OWASP events. If I can't get one more person to volunteer as a Chapter Leader, then OWASP will shut down our chapter.</p> <p>Next, for OWASP global events, we are always looking for reviewers of submissions. We get people who want to give talks and trainings at our events and as a reviewer, you would be asked to read their proposal and score it. It takes roughly 10 minutes per submission. In return, you get a discount on the event. Drop me a line if you're interested in doing this in the future and I'll add you to the list.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing all of you, and especially those of you that have recently joined.</p> <p>You can reach out to me directly with any questions: bil.corry@owasp.org</p> <p>Best regards,</p> <p>- Bil</p> "}]
