What's attacking known vulnerabilities on open-source code? Are you able to tie vulnerability and attack data to help prioritize your risk? Why do some applications have certain vulnerabilities and others don't? Join David Lindner, CISO, at Contrast Security as he reviews the latest in AppSec vulnerability and attack trends spelled out in the Contrast Labs Bimonthly and Yearly AppSec Intelligence Reports . In this talk, David will explain:</p> <p>- Vulnerabilities that are found in a subset of applications but absent in others</p> <p>- The numbers of attacks an application received on average</p> <p>- Prevalence of vulnerabilities versus the likelihood that they will be exploited</p> <p>- Meantime to Resolution (MTTR) in protected assets</p> <p>- A \"watch list\" of vulnerabilities that require special scrutiny</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>David is an experienced Application Security Professional with over 18 years of experience in the computer security industry. During this time, David has worked within multiple disciplines in the security field, from application development, network architecture design and support, IT security and consulting, security training, and application security. Over the past 10 years, David has specialized in all things related to mobile applications and securing them. David has supported many different clients including financial, government, automobile, healthcare, and retail. In his spare time, David is seen on the golf course or honing his mobile testing skills by participating in numerous bug bounties.</p> <p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlindner/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlindner/</a></p> <p>Twitter: @golfhackerdave</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>5:45pm: Introduction, Presentation &amp; Q&amp;A<br/>At end of meeting: Raffle (two $50 gift certificates sponsored by Contrast Security)</p> <p>Unlike our usual in-person meetings, this event is BYOB.

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.</p> <p>The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP &amp; the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.</p> <p>The BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.</p> <p>Speaker Biographies &amp; Abstracts</p> <p>Stewart Garrick (Law Enforcement Liaison and Operations Manager), Shadowserver Foundation. \"The Shadowserver Foundation, who we are, what we do and why we love doing it!\u201d</p> <p>Bio: Stewart Garrick (Law Enforcement Liaison and Operations Manager)</p> <p>Shadowserver member for 5 years.
