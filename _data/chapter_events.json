The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model and the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which are presented in the talk, show security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.</p> <p>In this session Timo will give an introduction and answers questions like when to use OWASP SAMM and when and how to use DSOMM.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Timo has been in the IT industry for over twenty years. After being a system administrator and web developer in his early times, he became involved in OWASP. He now advises his clients on DevOps security, either hands on or as a trainer, with the focus on security test automation for software and infrastructure.<br/>more details :<br/><a href=\"https://pagel.pro/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pagel.pro/</a></p> "}, {"chapter": "Copenhagen", "repo": "www-chapter-copenhagen", "name": "Panel Debate, Post Pandemic Cybersecurity", "date": "2021-01-21", "time": "20:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Copenhagen-Chapter/events/275404398/", "timezone": "Europe/Copenhagen", "description": "<p>On January 21st you will have the opportunity to listen to and ask questions for not one, but three panelists about security in a post-pandemic world.</p> <p>As we move into this mid- and post-pandemic world with remote and in-office work blending, what must organizations consider, in order to sustain data and application security and privacy while still considering an efficient working- and user experience?

With this step, OWASP confirms the increasing importance of API security for companies. The talk looks at the new risks and contrasts them with the top 10 risks for web applications. While security products can help to mitigate certain risks as an additional defense line, API developers have the ultimate responsibility for their code and must know the risks to avoid them.</p> <p>This will be an online live event (link will be added before the event).</p> <p>Speaker Biodata of Mr. Md Jahangir Alam:<br/>Md Jahangir Alam is the leader of the OWASP Dhaka Chapter.

Zero Trust makes attackers' lives hard! You'll leave this talk with three main takeaways: 1) Why Zero Trust design is so important for web application design. 2) A phased approach you can take with your old and new projects. 3) Learn about a simple, secure, scalable Zero Trust reference design you can implement using Okta and Cloudflare (and see a demo!).</p> <p>Biography: Michael is a senior member of BCI's Cyber Security Engineering team and a champion of Zero Trust designs.
