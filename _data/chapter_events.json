He started the Belgian OWASP chapter, was a member of the OWASP Foundation Board and performed several public presentations on Application Security. Seba also co-founded the yearly security &amp; hacker BruCON conference and trainings in Belgium. With a background in development and many years of experience in security, he has trained countless developers to create software more securely. He has led OWASP projects such as OWASP SAMM, thereby truly making the world a little bit safer. Now he is adapting application security models to the evolving field of DevOps and is also focused on bringing Threat Modeling to a wider audience.</p> <p>Desription</p> <p>OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices. We will cover a number of topics in the talk:<br/>the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, the measurement model which was setup to cover both coverage and quality and the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example development team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Jakarta", "repo": "www-chapter-jakarta", "name": "Strategic Usage of OWASP SAMM and OWASP DSOMM", "date": "2021-01-23", "time": "15:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Jakarta-Chapter/events/275425229/", "timezone": "Asia/Jakarta", "description": "<p>Strategic Usage of OWASP SAMM and OWASP DSOMM</p> <p>Description :<br/>From a startup to a multinational corporation the software development industry is currently dominated by agile frameworks and product teams and as part of it DevOps strategies.</p> <p>It has been observed that during implementation, security aspects can be missed. The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model and the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which are presented in the talk, show security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.</p> <p>In this session Timo will give an introduction and answers questions like when to use OWASP SAMM and when and how to use DSOMM.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Timo has been in the IT industry for over twenty years.

Building security into the software development and management practices of a company can be a daunting task. There are many elements to the equation: company structure, different stakeholders, technology stacks, tools and processes, and so forth. Implementing software assurance will have a significant impact on the organization. Yet, trying to achieve this without a good framework is most likely leading to just marginal and unsustainable improvements. OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) gives you a structural and measurable framework to do just that. It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organization. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices.<br/>We will cover a number of topics in the talk: (i) the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, (ii) the measurement model which was set up to cover both coverage and quality and (iii) the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example DevOps team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.<br/>Bio: Brian Glas has worked in IT for almost 20 years and information/application security for the last decade. He started as an enterprise Java developer, then transitioned to helping build an application security program as both tech lead and manager. He later played the role of enterprise architect and did a little incident response and reverse engineering malware for fun. Glas then spent a number of years as a consultant helping clients build AppSec programs, create/update SDLCs, and other related initiatives. He has worked on the Trustworthy Computing team at Microsoft and is now an assistant professor of Computer Science at Union University authoring a Cybersecurity program.

All of these have two major things in common; seamless connectivity and huge data transfer. This also results in plenty of additional opportunities for significant data breaches and associated cyber security threats. The objective of traditional digital forensics is to identify, collect, analyse, and present digital evidence, collected from various mediums, in a cyber related incident; the exponential growth of IoT devices and the increasing number of cyber security incidents has given birth to the term IoT forensics and the resulting challenges. Additionally, most IoT devices come with no inbuilt security features and there is a requirement for more research into IoT devices security, IoT forensic readiness, and a forensic framework for IoT device.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "}, {"chapter": "Switzerland", "repo": "www-chapter-switzerland", "name": "ZAP Automation in CI/CD", "date": "2021-02-09", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/275004625/", "timezone": "Europe/Zurich", "description": "<p>OWASP ZAP is probably the most frequently used web application scanner in the world, and automation is one of its strengths.<br/>In this talk Simon will explain the different options you have for running ZAP in a CI/CD pipeline ranging from the packaged scans to directly driving the ZAP API.<br/>He will also explain (and maybe even demo) a new ZAP automation framework which is currently under development.</p> <p>ZAP is an OWASP flagship project and you can find more information on <a href=\"https://www.zaproxy.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.zaproxy.org/</a> .</p> <p>About your speaker:<br/>Simon Bennetts is the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Project Leader and a Distinguished Engineer at StackHawk, a company that uses ZAP to help users fix application security bugs before they hit production.<br/>He has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA &amp; AsiaPac.<br/>Prior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years and strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.</p> "}]
