Announcements</p> <p>2. A Client-Side Data Encryption Solution for Cloud-Based Systems</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions usually offer data at rest encryption for common storage solutions like databases and filesystems. This has the potential to reveal sensitive information to the third party\u2019s employees or to any malicious actor. For highly sensitive information this could be undesirable and in these scenarios it could be highly desirable to encrypt data prior to storing it with a IaaS or PasS provider to mitigate this risk. . In this talk we\u2019ll present two open source Ruby libraries that we have developed to aide in the deployment of solutions that require this degree of protection, we\u2019ll cover the architecture of the solution and the third party services that they are currently compatible with.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Brent Carrara is a software developer turned security professional passionate about building security into large scale systems. As the Head of Security at Ario, he is responsible for establishing and maintaining the security program for the financial technology startup. Brent holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Waterloo in Software Engineering, a Master\u2019s degree from the University of Ottawa in Digital Identity and Biometrics and a PhD from the University of Ottawa in Covert Channels. He has published papers in various security topics including information hiding, digital credentials, biometric authentication and covert communication.</p> <p>Weiyun Lu is a software developer at Thinking Capital with a focus on the security of the platform. He holds Masters degrees from the University of Ottawa in mathematics (algebras of many-valued and quantum logics) and computer science (formal verification of code obfuscation algorithms). At heart a pure mathematician, he transitioned to the software field out of his interest in cryptography and formal theorem proving. He also has a nocturnal alter ego as a bassist in a metal band that has played throughout Ontario and Quebec.</p> <p>3. Enforcing Code &amp; Security Standards with Semgrep</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>We\u2019ll discuss a program analysis tool we\u2019re developing called Semgrep (<a href=\"https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#semgrep\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#semgrep</a>). It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle (<a href=\"http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/\" class=\"linkified\">http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/</a>), for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook.</p> <p>Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Colleen Dai is a security software engineer at r2c, a startup working on building static analysis tools that focus on precision and being custom-fit to the consumer. At r2c, Colleen has worked on the language parsing along with AST matching. She is also writing rules to find security vulnerabilities in open source code. Colleen recently received her B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Statistics from Stanford. She regularly enjoys Brazilian Jiujitsu, drawing, and trying (and failing) not to eat everything in her fridge.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Uruguay", "repo": "www-chapter-uruguay", "name": "Requerimientos de seguridad y c\u00f3mo probarlos [OWASP (A/MA)SVS y (W/M)STG ]", "date": "2020-11-05", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Uruguay-Chapter/events/273937682/", "timezone": "America/Montevideo", "description": "<p>En esta Meetup virtual les contaremos sobre dos proyectos de OWASP que nos permitir\u00e1n definir niveles de seguridad para nuestras aplicaciones, as\u00ed como requerimientos a cumplir, tareas a realizar durante el desarrollo de una aplicaci\u00f3n y como podemos probar el cumplimiento de dichos requerimientos.</p> <p>OWASP ASVS / MASVS: el Est\u00e1ndar de Verificaci\u00f3n de Seguridad de Aplicaciones y el Est\u00e1ndar de Verificaci\u00f3n de Seguridad de Aplicaciones M\u00f3viles (MASVS) de OWASP son, como su nombre lo indica, est\u00e1ndares para la seguridad de aplicaciones web y m\u00f3viles, respectivamente.</p> <p>Pueden ser utilizado por arquitectos, desarrolladores y testers de software que buscan desarrollar aplicaciones seguras, pero tambi\u00e9n puede ser utilizado por los expertos en seguridad para comprobar el nivel de seguridad, para garantizar la integridad y la coherencia de los resultados de las pruebas, dependiendo de si participaron en el proceso de desarrollo.

We'll cover IDORs/BOLAs, information disclosure, account takeovers, injection + more!
