This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages, but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p> <p>Intro of Speaker :- Ansh Bhawnani is a hackfluencer and a security researcher. He is a cyber security trainer and has been teaching cyber security since past 4 years. He has a YouTube channel with over 108K subscribers.</p> <p>Unrestricted File Upload :- Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.</p> <p>Intro of Speaker :-</p> <p>Raju Kumar is currently Synack Red Team member. He has participated in many bug bounties program &amp; Recognised by many Companies likeDell, Mastercard, Netgear, DigitalOcean , Western Union, Genymotion and many more for finding a critical vulnerability in their website.</p> <p>RSVP Link :- <a href=\"https://forms.gle/nAWyTSb5LgUmS2N3A\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/nAWyTSb5LgUmS2N3A</a></p> "}, {"chapter": "Northern Virginia", "repo": "www-chapter-northern-virginia", "name": "AppSec, DevSecOps, and IoT - Oh My!", "date": "2020-08-20", "time": "18:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Northern-Virginia-Chapter/events/272348331/", "timezone": "US/Eastern", "description": "<p>Abstract: It doesn't take much to realize that the world of IoT has exploded. How many now have a Ring doorbell and are using Alexa to control their homes? Sensors, indicators and trackers are everywhere and many times we are not even aware of it. But in a world where there is an ever-increasing threat landscape and more attacks then ever, where does security fit in? How do we balance convenience, speed and data integrity? And when we realize that behind every device is an application that will process that data and then communicate to another application, how do we ensure that those applications are secure? This is why Application Security and DevSecOps are so important in this space and make all the difference between success and failure.</p> <p>Bio: Rob is currently a Global Application Security Sales Evangelist for HCL providing thought leadership for the application security space, particularly as it relates to DevOps and DevSecOps initiatives.
