We'll cover IDORs/BOLAs, information disclosure, account takeovers, injection + more! Showing how even the simplest of software issues, a missing if statement, can snowball into a major security breach.

Te\u0161ko je pratiti da li nove komponente i ovisnosti otvaraju nove prilike malicioznim osobama. Stoga kontinuirano automatizirano skeniranje koda i integracije aplikacije je ne\u0161to bez \u010dega aplikacija ne mo\u017ee u produkciju. Skeniranje se vr\u0161i s vi\u0161e me\u0111usobno nepovezanih alata. Me\u0111utim tu je DefectDojo da olak\u0161a \u017eivot i integrira Vulnerability Management u razvoj aplikacija i \u017eivotni ciklus.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dubravko Sever: Nakon dugog niza godina u Sveu\u010dili\u0161nom ra\u010dunskom centru SRCE, danas zaposlen kao sigurnjak u Deutsche Telekom, Pan-net, gdje se bavi sigurno\u0161\u0107u Clouda (in/of) kao i sigurno\u0161\u0107u orkestrirane okoline mikroservisa.</p> <p>Grayson Hardaway: Enforcing Code &amp; Security Standards with Semgrep<br/>We\u2019ll discuss a program analysis tool we\u2019re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c.</p> <p>Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.</p> <p>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Or find hardcoded credentials using the query:<br/>boto3.client(..., aws_secret_access_key=\u201d...\u201d, aws_access_key_id=\u201d...\u201d )</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep</a><br/>Test in your browser: <a href=\"https://semgrep.live/\" class=\"linkified\">https://semgrep.live/</a></p> <p>Bio:<br/>Grayson Hardaway is a security researcher at r2c, a startup working on static analysis tools purpose-built for the modern workflow. At r2c, Grayson authors static analysis tailored for finding security vulnerabilities in open source code. Previously, Grayson worked for the US Department of Defense fuzzing and exploiting obscure protocols. When not submitting patches, Grayson is hefting a heavy pack uphill, crafting guitar solos, or learning something new: currently woodworking.</p> "}]
