Dashcams create numerous artefacts of evidential value such as GPS data, temporal data, vehicular speed data, audio, video and photographic images. Dashcam usage has increased over the last few years with 9% of drivers using dashcams in 2015, 17% in 2017, and 27% in 2018 (Aviva, 2018). This number is expected to increase remarkably, particularly with some manufacturers planning to incorporate dashcam capability within new car design. Dashcam evidence is essential in road-traffic related incidents as well as to provide evidence of in-vehicle activity. Despite their importance, there is a paucity of research into dashcam forensics, and there are no known tools that enable dashcam forensics.</p> <p>This talk highlights the work that we are doing in supporting this field. The talk provides an overview of the evidential value of dashcam devices, methods of extracting the evidence, efforts to develop a useful dashcam evidence dataset, and then reports on three prototypes aimed at extracting dashcam evidence.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:15 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:30 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:45 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "}, {"chapter": "Somerset", "repo": "www-chapter-somerset", "name": "Exploring OWASP ZAP", "date": "2020-12-18", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Somerset-Chapter/events/273592981/", "timezone": "US/Eastern", "description": "<p>If you are not familiar with the OWASP ZAP project this is a great chance to get an introduction to a powerful, free web app scanner.
