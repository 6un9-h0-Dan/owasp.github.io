The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model and the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which are presented in the talk, show security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.</p> <p>In this session Timo will give an introduction and answers questions like when to use OWASP SAMM and when and how to use DSOMM.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Timo has been in the IT industry for over twenty years. After being a system administrator and web developer in his early times, he became involved in OWASP. He now advises his clients on DevOps security, either hands on or as a trainer, with the focus on security test automation for software and infrastructure.<br/>more details :<br/><a href=\"https://pagel.pro/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pagel.pro/</a></p> "}, {"chapter": "Copenhagen", "repo": "www-chapter-copenhagen", "name": "Panel Debate, Post Pandemic Cybersecurity", "date": "2021-01-21", "time": "20:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Copenhagen-Chapter/events/275404398/", "timezone": "Europe/Copenhagen", "description": "<p>On January 21st you will have the opportunity to listen to and ask questions for not one, but three panelists about security in a post-pandemic world.</p> <p>As we move into this mid- and post-pandemic world with remote and in-office work blending, what must organizations consider, in order to sustain data and application security and privacy while still considering an efficient working- and user experience?
