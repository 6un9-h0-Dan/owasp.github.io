While there are overlapping skills, there are differences that will be discussed as Phillip shares his experience of going from a pentester to a red teamer. In this talk, you will learn about the different areas that make up red team operations, common tools, and the path to becoming a red teamer.

While integrating security into CI/CD offers many benefits, it is critical to understand that a full SSA program encompasses a variety of activities \u2013 many of which are incompatible with run time restrictions and other constraints imposed by these pipelines. This webinar looks at the breadth of activities involved in a mature SSA program and steps through the aspects of a program that can be realistically included in a pipeline, as well as those that cannot. It also reviews how these activities and related tooling have evolved over time as the application security discipline has matured and as development teams started to focus on cloud-native development techniques and technologies.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Dan Cornell,</p> <p>Bio:<br/>A globally recognized application security expert, Dan Cornell holds over 15 years of experience architecting, developing and securing web-based software systems.
