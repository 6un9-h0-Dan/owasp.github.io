Simply put if Cyber is in the business of Revenue Protection, then we need to have a defense in depth plan to combat the biggest threats to our companies. This matrix allows a company to overlay their major threats with the NIST Cyber Security Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, &amp; Recover) to build a robust security plan. Organizations which perform this activity will gain a better understanding of how to protect their company as they fill in safeguards which mitigate important threats. Remember the devil is in the details, hence why we chose a TaSManian Devil as the project logo.</p> <p>Ross Young is the CISO of Caterpillar Financial, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, and a SANS instructor. Prior to this role, he was a divisional CISO at Capital One. His expertise ranges from attacking financial services for the federal government to defending organizations by automating defenses in DevSecOps pipelines. He is actively involved in all things cloud, container, and Kubernetes security. Ross holds master's and bachelor's degrees from Johns Hopkins University, Idaho State University, and Utah State University.

To make this process easier, Olivia has created a workbook that beginning developers can use to supplement their study of the OWASP Top 10.

She started out hacking in June 2019 during a HackerOne mentorship program and now hopes to be a mentor to others, creating educational cyber security videos on YouTube. In her videos, she attempts to bridge the gap between \"I know what bug bounties are\" and \"bug bounty hunter\" giving advice specifically tailored to bug hunting. She's now produced over 50 videos on bug bounty hunting for an audience of over 25,000 YouTube subscribers. Aimed at a beginner audience these go from finding your first bug, to how to use specific tools, to how to find specific bug classes.<br/>Katie has discovered and responsibly reported security vulnerabilities to several large organisations such as Verizon Media and the US Department of Defense</p> "}, {"chapter": "Norway", "repo": "www-chapter-norway", "name": "Google's Differential Privacy Library \u2013 Mirac Vuslat Basaran (Google)", "date": "2021-03-17", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Norway/events/276469937/", "timezone": "Europe/Oslo", "description": "<p>Differential privacy helps organizations derive insights from data while simultaneously ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or re-identified.

In order to successfully respond to Security incidents we needed a centralized platform which aggregates all the data about our premises in a single place.</p> <p>Surface Security (Security Intelligence Automation Platform) is an internally built tool which assists our internal Security teams to gain a holistic view about our externally exposed assets. More than that, it facilitates faster incident response based on the information correlated by it. Surface started as a small project in which we tried to close the gaps identified in our security controls. The platform's core is built in Django which is a Python-based open-source framework which has a fast learning curve. Besides Django, we're using technologies like Ansible (automation), Dkron (fault-tolerant jobs), Elasticsearch (Security metrics storage) and Grafana (reporting). During the whole period it gained a lot of traction in our company determining people to contribute to its success by implementing and suggesting new features. We're currently utilizing it for reporting the Security gaps to other areas of key business areas and for Security controls like: monitoring our externally exposed assets, vulnerability management, security incidents, bug bounty reports and penetration testing.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>I'm focused on Application Security Engineering &amp; Penetration Testing combined with CAMS mindset (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing - DevSecOps) and I reported security bugs to Google, Facebook, Uber, Bitdefender, ING Bank, Yahoo or other companies. One of the most interesting thing is that I built a platform \"Surface - Security Intelligence Automation Platform\" which is being used by more than 900 people in Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter and I was the Security SME for a Private Cloud based on OpenStack with environments as code.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep<br/>We\u2019ll discuss a program analysis tool we\u2019re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c. Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.<br/>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Bence Nagy is a software engineer at r2c, working on Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.dev web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic\u2019s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019.

Traditionally OWASP runs several conferences a year, but with the pandemic, we've switched to virtual events with mixed success.</p> <p>We also have some housekeeping items to do. As you may know, I was elected to the OWASP Global Board of Directors and am serving as the Secretary for 2021. In addition, I also volunteer as the Nashua Chapter Leader, and I am on the 2021 Training Planning Committee, and I am on the Compliance Committee, and I am on the Trademark Board Committee, and I am on the Policy Review Committee.</p> <p>That's a lot of volunteering and I need some help.</p> <p>Chapters are now required to have at least two leaders, so I need at least one more of you to step up as a chapter leader for Nashua (we can have a max of five I believe). The role entails setting up meetings and finding speakers for them. Pretty easy stuff! As a Chapter Leader, you'll get discounts on OWASP events. If I can't get one more person to volunteer as a Chapter Leader, then OWASP will shut down our chapter.</p> <p>Next, for OWASP global events, we are always looking for reviewers of submissions. We get people who want to give talks and trainings at our events and as a reviewer, you would be asked to read their proposal and score it. It takes roughly 10 minutes per submission. In return, you get a discount on the event. Drop me a line if you're interested in doing this in the future and I'll add you to the list.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing all of you, and especially those of you that have recently joined.</p> <p>You can reach out to me directly with any questions: bil.corry@owasp.org</p> <p>Best regards,</p> <p>- Bil</p> "}]
