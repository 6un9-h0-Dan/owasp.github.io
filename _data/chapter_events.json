MPC has been studied for several decades, which has led to many different protocols with multiple security-performance trade-offs, as well as a large knowledge base on the theoretical limits of this technology.</p> <p>It is natural to expect something as powerful and general as MPC to be overly complicated and hard to grasp. However, it turns out that many of the core ideas used in MPC are not really that complex, and one can get a fairly solid understanding of the field by learning these concepts. The goal of this talk is to introduce the audience to what MPC is, present some basic terminology, and discuss some essential results and constructions that serve as the basis for many other practically-oriented protocols. In a bit more detail, the talk will start by introducing some essential concepts in MPC like honest and dishonest majority or passive and active security, then we will discuss what is known to be achievable and what is known to be impossible, and proceed to present some basic constructions based on additive and Shamir secret-sharing.</p> <p>---<br/>Presenter: Daniel Escudero (<a href=\"https://deescuderoo.github.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://deescuderoo.github.io</a>)</p> <p>I'm a last year PhD student at Aarhus University, Denmark, working under the supervision of Ivan Damg\u00e5rd. My background is in Mathematics, and my current interests are the different interactions between these and Cryptography, specially when it comes to performing computation on 'hidden' data. I am also interested in the applicability of these techniques to different real-world challenges. I also enjoy knowledge dissemination, and I am a strong believer of the existing value in making seemingly complex idea simple.</p> <p>---<br/>Co-hosted with Cryptography Meetup: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cryptography-Meetup\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Cryptography-Meetup</a></p> <p>The goal of the Cryptography Meetup is to make cryptography more approachable for programmers.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a programmer looking to explore, understand and build systems that use cryptographic algorithms, come learn with us. If you\u2019re a cryptographer come share your knowledge with implementers.</p> <p>We start all our discussions &amp; presentations from the basics, without assuming any prior knowledge of complex mathematics or cryptographic primitives.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Orange County", "repo": "www-chapter-orange-county", "name": "Virtual Meeting: The Latest Web Application Threats Discovered and Revealed", "date": "2020-12-15", "time": "17:45", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-OC/events/275046305/", "timezone": "US/Pacific", "description": "<p>Speaker: David Lindner, CISO, at Contrast Security</p> <p>Topic: The Latest Web Application Threats Discovered and Revealed</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Open Web AI Security Project may be the future of application security Want to learn what the \"watch list\" of application vulnerabilities needs to be today? What's attacking known vulnerabilities on open-source code? Are you able to tie vulnerability and attack data to help prioritize your risk? Why do some applications have certain vulnerabilities and others don't? Join David Lindner, CISO, at Contrast Security as he reviews the latest in AppSec vulnerability and attack trends spelled out in the Contrast Labs Bimonthly and Yearly AppSec Intelligence Reports . In this talk, David will explain:</p> <p>- Vulnerabilities that are found in a subset of applications but absent in others</p> <p>- The numbers of attacks an application received on average</p> <p>- Prevalence of vulnerabilities versus the likelihood that they will be exploited</p> <p>- Meantime to Resolution (MTTR) in protected assets</p> <p>- A \"watch list\" of vulnerabilities that require special scrutiny</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>David is an experienced Application Security Professional with over 18 years of experience in the computer security industry. During this time, David has worked within multiple disciplines in the security field, from application development, network architecture design and support, IT security and consulting, security training, and application security.
