Whether you are in consulting, data science, development, security or operations, technology has a subculture ceiling that is in need of transformation.<br/>Along with the stresses of COVID-19, now more than ever technology professionals are announcing \"we need a better quality of worklife and balance\"! How do you speak up for your career well-being? How can emotional intelligence and leadership skills help you improve your work environment and build better relationships to improve your career strategy? Erin breaks down the invisible skill set and how you can harness it to improve your own career outcomes.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Erin Leslie is a leadership coach who will enable any professional or team<br/>to achieve their career aspirations through personal development,<br/>planning and coaching. She believes that every career could benefit from mentorship; she sees the opportunity in anyone who is stuck or does not know the right actions, to propel them towards their next success. Erin practices one-on-one coaching with clients and mentees across all industries. Certified in EQ-i 2.0 assessments, Erin specializes in emotional intelligence practices and tools to support a stronger Emotional Quotient in the workplace.</p> <p>Her Emotional Intelligence keynote provides insights from 20 years as a business career woman in tech; combined with a tailored coaching style she has the intuitive ability to uncover personal or environmental<br/>barriers and help identify new goals for your business audience. Helping professionals, teams and new comers with all aspects of business negotiation, personal branding, networking and business culture is not only a vocation, it is her passion.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Vancouver", "repo": "www-chapter-vancouver", "name": "Get Your Dream Security Job", "date": "2021-02-23", "time": "17:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Vancouver-Chapter/events/276278027/", "timezone": "Canada/Pacific", "description": "<p>OWASP Vancouver and Bay Area chapters present our first joint event!</p> <p>There are amazing jobs within security, but getting them can feel daunting!

The presentation is based on a TEDex talk of Ernesto Sirolli where he talks about his experiences as aid-work volunteer in the 70s and what he learned from it.</p> <p>Where he commented on a failure as \"at least we fed the hippos\".</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>The security community is trying to solve insecurity caused by bugs and flaws in software for many years now, but with what success?<br/>We almost never look at successes and failures experiences in other areas, but we could really learn from them. This talk is inspired by Ernesto Sirolli\u2019s TED talk \u201cWant to help someone? Shut up and listen!\u201d about failures in aid programs around the world. Listening to Ernesto Sirolli, you cannot miss the similarity with the security community trying to tell developers how to write secure code. This talk points out common failures of the security community when communicating with developers, trying to solve their problems without understanding what their problems really are.<br/>Using the hippo-analogy for resource wasted and security failures. During the talks, those \u2018(in-)secure hippos\u2019 are identified, advice on how to avoid them are provided, by anecdotes and best practices from the perience of the past 15 years in the security field of information / application security.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Martin Knobloch, Global AppSec Strategist at Micro Focus, is a long-time information security leader with more than 15 years of experience in the field.

Starting strong in the new year, we have Philippe De Ryck detailing pros and cons for various API authentication frameworks.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Compared to a decade ago, the meaning of authentication has changed significantly. Modern applications not only authenticate users but also rely on authentication for API access and inter-service communication. Authentication mechanisms still include passwords, but also rely on API keys, signed JWT tokens, and cryptographic authenticators. With so many options to choose from, making the right choice becomes a difficult challenge.</p> <p>In this session, we explore several authentication recipes for different scenarios. We will discuss authentication in API-based applications, microservice architectures, and, of course, modern user authentication scenarios. At the end of this session, you will be able to choose the right authentication mechanism for your application according to current best practices.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Philippe De Ryck helps developers protect companies through better web security. His Ph.D. in web security from KU Leuven lies at the basis of his exceptional knowledge of the security landscape. As the founder of Pragmatic Web Security, Philippe delivers security training and security consulting to companies worldwide. His online course platform allows anyone to learn complex security topics at their own pace.

While integrating security into CI/CD offers many benefits, it is critical to understand that a full SSA program encompasses a variety of activities \u2013 many of which are incompatible with run time restrictions and other constraints imposed by these pipelines. This webinar looks at the breadth of activities involved in a mature SSA program and steps through the aspects of a program that can be realistically included in a pipeline, as well as those that cannot.

All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.</p> <p>The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP &amp; the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.</p> <p>The BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.</p> <p>Speaker Biographies &amp; Abstracts</p> <p>Dr Tim French FBCS FRSA MIET, Teaching Fellow Cyber Sec, Inst of Coding , Dept Computer Science, University of Bath. \"Cyber Sec in Connected Cars: a \u201cGreen field\u201d opportunity or<br/>\u201cold Wine in new Bottles\"? - It\u2019s all a question of Trust!\u201d</p> <p>Bio: Dr Tim French FBCS FRSA MIET, Teaching Fellow Cyber Sec, Inst of Coding , Dept Computer Science, University of Bath.</p> <p>Time was previously a Research &amp; Development Cyber Sec Senior Systems Engineer &amp; Cyber lead for a Global OEM.

The aim is to provide a brief \"insider\" insight (from a global OEM oriented perspective) of a complex and rapidly evolving domain. Given the ever-widening adversarial attack surface, OEM\u2019s, regulators, and governments must establish priorities. But, from an OEMs perspective any c/m must also retain profit margins in a highly competitive industry.</p> <p>Relay attack, LiDar \"blinding\" , V2X , back end, End2end, Infotainment, ...where should cyber resilience efforts be best focussed and by whom?</p> <p>After briefly reviewing the automotive cyber regulatory landscape, and examining some key vulnerabilities, exploits and counter-measures it is suggested that only by seeking to promote multiple stakeholder cooperation by OEM\u2019s, Thatcham, DoT &amp; regulators (i.e. seeing the bigger picture, avoiding silos) can ensure that the modern connected car, AVs &amp; associated 'Smart City' Eco-systems, offer intrinsically safer, more resilient vehicles.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>17:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>17:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>18:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> <p>(Please register on the link provided)</p> "}]
