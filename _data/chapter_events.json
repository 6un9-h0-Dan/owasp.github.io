By the time controls are put in place to thwart the technical IOCs, attackers change it and counter with new attacks. So, it becomes essential for defenders to continuously automate the Threat Intelligence actioning and harness the tactical information as well used by attackers and have countermeasures in place.</p> <p>By automating Threat Intel collection, analysis, and dissemination, we can deduce predictive intelligence providing greater visibility to the organizations while allowing them to anticipate and counter threats even before they attack. We will discuss how end-to-end threat intelligence automation in a closed trusted sharing environment could be used to operationalize actionable and relevant predictive intelligence by correlating, enriching, and analyzing threat data collected in real-time from a wide range of external and internal sources over a hub and spoke sharing model. We will also cover advanced automation strategies for the full threat intelligence lifecycle while detailing how mutual threat sightings could be used to identify and prioritize threats with precision confidence.</p> <p>High Level Agenda for Presentation</p> <p>Collective Defense Vs Passive Defense Vs Active Defense</p> <p>Threat Intelligence and Its types</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Operationalisation</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Automation / Orchestration</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Collaboration</p> <p>Collective Defense</p> <p>Takeaways</p> <p>---<br/>Short bio :<br/>Avkash K<br/>VP - Research and Innovation at Cyware Labs</p> <p>Information Security professional with overall 12+ years of experience in Information Security domain.

Red team has been used as a general term for all areas of offensive security just as blue team for defensive security. True red teaming goes Beyond Pentesting and into more adversarial emulation. While there are overlapping skills, there are differences that will be discussed as Phillip shares his experience of going from a pentester to a red teamer. In this talk, you will learn about the different areas that make up red team operations, common tools, and the path to becoming a red teamer. In this presentation, you will learn about resources helpful for a path into red teaming.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Phillip Wylie is a Lead Curriculum Developer at Point3 Federal, Adjunct Instructor at Dallas College (formerly Richland College), and The Pwn School Project founder.

Jason began his journey into information security through necessity as he built skills and knowledge through his roles in leading internal initiatives for securing application and cloud infrastructure. After years of blue team and developer/devops roles, his interests centre around offensive security and wanting to help organizations actively find problems rather than just follow best practices and hope for the best.</p> <p>* Cayce Mahon<br/>Has over nine years of experience in Information Security. Originally graduating with an AFA in fine art , she took a unique path of education in regards to her transition into information security. Through persistence and self-study, she was able to obtain a Security+ and OSCP certification on her own. While at OccamSec, she has led and has been a part of a variety of offensive engagements in the realms of cyber and physical security (security/penetration testing of applications, network/physical infrastructure and systems) as well as risk assessment (architecture/policy review, vulnerability assessment, and employee interviews). Finding crucial fault points in an organization\u2019s infrastructure while also adapting to the ever changing demands of the clients she works with.</p> <p>* Ivano Bianco<br/>Italian, with a fake Russian accent. Started using computers at the tender age of 11, by the age of 14 he switched from the BASIC language to Assembly and started to circumvent copy protections for fun. Spent the next 20 years working in IT Operations, keeping systems secure and automating deployments before job titles like \"IT Security Engineer\" and \"DevOps Engineer\" were a thing.</p> <p>Had the opportunity to cover technical hands-on roles for a multitude of SME and multinational companies such as: - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale - H3G - Ericsson - Global Payments \u2013 Puppet.</p> <p>Nowadays he prefers to focus on penetration testing, web application testing (because breaking things is always fun), threat hunting and security awareness training. He still likes to figure out why a server is down, but will not fix your computer.</p> <p>* Nicholas Donarski<br/>Has been a pioneer in the Information Security field for over 20 years. During this time, he\u2019s worked with a diverse client list which includes multinational and global organizations, Federal, State and Local government, and enterprises of all sizes. He is recognized in the international community as a senior authority on PenTesting strategy, operations, tools and training. Over the years, he\u2019s continued to expand his experience in security to include network security, mobile, web, and application security, compliance, high threat physical security and RedTeam Operations. Recently, he\u2019s focused on the development of security architecture and development around machine learning and Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI).</p> <p>TICKETS:<br/>This event is free to attend for both members and non-members of OWASP and is open to anyone interested in application security and cyber security.
