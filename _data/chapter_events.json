By the time controls are put in place to thwart the technical IOCs, attackers change it and counter with new attacks. So, it becomes essential for defenders to continuously automate the Threat Intelligence actioning and harness the tactical information as well used by attackers and have countermeasures in place.</p> <p>By automating Threat Intel collection, analysis, and dissemination, we can deduce predictive intelligence providing greater visibility to the organizations while allowing them to anticipate and counter threats even before they attack. We will discuss how end-to-end threat intelligence automation in a closed trusted sharing environment could be used to operationalize actionable and relevant predictive intelligence by correlating, enriching, and analyzing threat data collected in real-time from a wide range of external and internal sources over a hub and spoke sharing model. We will also cover advanced automation strategies for the full threat intelligence lifecycle while detailing how mutual threat sightings could be used to identify and prioritize threats with precision confidence.</p> <p>High Level Agenda for Presentation</p> <p>Collective Defense Vs Passive Defense Vs Active Defense</p> <p>Threat Intelligence and Its types</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Operationalisation</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Automation / Orchestration</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Collaboration</p> <p>Collective Defense</p> <p>Takeaways</p> <p>---<br/>Short bio :<br/>Avkash K<br/>VP - Research and Innovation at Cyware Labs</p> <p>Information Security professional with overall 12+ years of experience in Information Security domain.

I will be attending in person, and will advise the first nine (9) who respond YES and want to attend that they have seats. All others will need to join the live stream.</p> <p>(2) If the Alert Level in Auckland is lowered to Level 2 in time, our in-person attendance limit will increase to 30.</p> <p>Our Tech Topic speaker, Laura Bell, will be presenting remotely, in either case.</p> <p>The in-person portion of our Meetup will gather at the Grid/AKL Tech Cafe, in the John Lysaght Building (101 Pakenham Street West, Auckland).</p> <p>We'll follow our usual meeting format, but with a shorter break. The order of activities will be:</p> <p>- Welcome, Introductions and Administrative Items<br/>- OWASP and Top 10 Overview Presentation: A1 - Injection (John DiLeo)<br/>- 10-minute break<br/>- Technical Presentation: Laura Bell, Founder and Principal at SafeStack (safestack.io)<br/>Title: Failing Fast<br/>Description: There is a lot of talk these days about going faster with security, DevSecOps and making security part of your lifecycle. In this talk we will explore three common mistakes teams make when embracing application security at speed and how you can avoid making them.</p> <p>Questions are welcome from the in-person audience, or submitted via Live Comments on the YouTube channel.</p> <p>------</p> <p>We also welcome event sponsorship in the form of providing refreshments and/or a location for our Meetups. Contact John, if you'd like to provide such support.</p> <p>We're always looking for presenters and topics for future meetings - contact John (john.dileo@owasp.org) if you have an idea for a topic, or a presentation you'd like to make.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Boulder", "repo": "www-chapter-boulder", "name": "Join us (virtually) for Denver/Boulder OWASP's September Meeting!!!", "date": "2020-09-16", "time": "17:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Boulder/events/273011214/", "timezone": "US/Mountain", "description": "<p>Topic: Account Takeover: Data Findings, Popular Tools, and Prevalent Actors</p> <p>In our latest account takeover (ATO) findings, we have observed a significant increase in credentials listed on the deep and dark web (15 billion and counting), tools that enable account takeover, and account takeover service advertisements on criminal marketplaces.
