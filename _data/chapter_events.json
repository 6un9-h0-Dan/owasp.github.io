Inspired by Hack the Box's King of the Hill, every second month, we are bringing you a night of hacking, to unleash your skills on a series of vulnerable machines, then defend against your opponents! This will be a team-based event where you are free to choose your own teams (minimum of 2 members and maximum of 4). If you are unable to find a team, let us know and we will help form a team for you.</p> <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers. The second rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers. Other than that, all attack vectors within the given IP range are allowed. This includes Denial of Service, Man-in-the-Middle, and any other attack methods you can think of that are usually banned from CTFs!</p> <p>Challenges will be of varying difficulties but the idea is the same -- break into a machine, plant your team's flag, then defend your machine(s) from other teams who will be trying to plant their own flag. The team whose flag is present once the time limit is up claims the points for that machine.</p> <p>At the end of the year, the top team from each Fight Club night will go head to head in our grand finale at BSides Sydney!</p> <p>To register please go to: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Ukb1gTZZLR7SALHA6\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/Ukb1gTZZLR7SALHA6</a></p> <p>Don't miss out on this opportunity to be crowned fight club champion!</p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<br/>OWASP Sydney does not guarantee that the ENVIRONMENT or any other associated website or servers, through which the content is made available to the Users, are provided without any \u201cvirus\u201d or harmful component.

All of these have two major things in common; seamless connectivity and huge data transfer. This also results in plenty of additional opportunities for significant data breaches and associated cyber security threats. The objective of traditional digital forensics is to identify, collect, analyse, and present digital evidence, collected from various mediums, in a cyber related incident; the exponential growth of IoT devices and the increasing number of cyber security incidents has given birth to the term IoT forensics and the resulting challenges. Additionally, most IoT devices come with no inbuilt security features and there is a requirement for more research into IoT devices security, IoT forensic readiness, and a forensic framework for IoT device.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "}, {"chapter": "Switzerland", "repo": "www-chapter-switzerland", "name": "ZAP Automation in CI/CD", "date": "2021-02-09", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/275004625/", "timezone": "Europe/Zurich", "description": "<p>OWASP ZAP is probably the most frequently used web application scanner in the world, and automation is one of its strengths.<br/>In this talk Simon will explain the different options you have for running ZAP in a CI/CD pipeline ranging from the packaged scans to directly driving the ZAP API.<br/>He will also explain (and maybe even demo) a new ZAP automation framework which is currently under development.</p> <p>ZAP is an OWASP flagship project and you can find more information on <a href=\"https://www.zaproxy.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.zaproxy.org/</a> .</p> <p>About your speaker:<br/>Simon Bennetts is the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Project Leader and a Distinguished Engineer at StackHawk, a company that uses ZAP to help users fix application security bugs before they hit production.<br/>He has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA &amp; AsiaPac.<br/>Prior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years and strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.</p> "}]
