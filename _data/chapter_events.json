Dr. Josephson obtained a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology from the University of Ottawa in 2004. Prior to this, he worked both internationally and in the Federal Government and as such he brings to his interactions with clients his experience and knowledge from working cross-culturally and in the culture of the Federal Government.</p> <p>Dr. Josephson provides psychotherapy and assessment services to adults experiencing a variety of challenges such as: anxiety, depression, stress, anger, relationship difficulties, career concerns and adjustment to major life changes (including injury and illness).</p> <p>Dr. Josephson has a longstanding interest in Health Psychology and in the role of Psychology in not only treating but preventing physical and mental health problems; particularly through assisting people to better understand and increase their motivation for emotional and physical self-care/fitness.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Jakarta", "repo": "www-chapter-jakarta", "name": "Strategic Usage of OWASP SAMM and OWASP DSOMM", "date": "2021-01-23", "time": "15:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Jakarta-Chapter/events/275425229/", "timezone": "Asia/Jakarta", "description": "<p>Strategic Usage of OWASP SAMM and OWASP DSOMM</p> <p>Description :<br/>From a startup to a multinational corporation the software development industry is currently dominated by agile frameworks and product teams and as part of it DevOps strategies.</p> <p>It has been observed that during implementation, security aspects can be missed. The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model and the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which are presented in the talk, show security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.</p> <p>In this session Timo will give an introduction and answers questions like when to use OWASP SAMM and when and how to use DSOMM.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Timo has been in the IT industry for over twenty years. After being a system administrator and web developer in his early times, he became involved in OWASP. He now advises his clients on DevOps security, either hands on or as a trainer, with the focus on security test automation for software and infrastructure.<br/>more details :<br/><a href=\"https://pagel.pro/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pagel.pro/</a></p> "}, {"chapter": "Copenhagen", "repo": "www-chapter-copenhagen", "name": "Panel Debate, Post Pandemic Cybersecurity", "date": "2021-01-21", "time": "20:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Copenhagen-Chapter/events/275404398/", "timezone": "Europe/Copenhagen", "description": "<p>On January 21st you will have the opportunity to listen to and ask questions for not one, but three panelists about security in a post-pandemic world.</p> <p>As we move into this mid- and post-pandemic world with remote and in-office work blending, what must organizations consider, in order to sustain data and application security and privacy while still considering an efficient working- and user experience?

Dashcams create numerous artefacts of evidential value such as GPS data, temporal data, vehicular speed data, audio, video and photographic images. Dashcam usage has increased over the last few years with 9% of drivers using dashcams in 2015, 17% in 2017, and 27% in 2018 (Aviva, 2018). This number is expected to increase remarkably, particularly with some manufacturers planning to incorporate dashcam capability within new car design. Dashcam evidence is essential in road-traffic related incidents as well as to provide evidence of in-vehicle activity. Despite their importance, there is a paucity of research into dashcam forensics, and there are no known tools that enable dashcam forensics.</p> <p>This talk highlights the work that we are doing in supporting this field. The talk provides an overview of the evidential value of dashcam devices, methods of extracting the evidence, efforts to develop a useful dashcam evidence dataset, and then reports on three prototypes aimed at extracting dashcam evidence.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:15 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:30 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:45 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "}, {"chapter": "Victoria", "repo": "www-chapter-victoria", "name": "January 2021 Virtual AppSec Meetup", "date": "2021-01-20", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Victoria-Chapter/events/275339332/", "timezone": "Canada/Pacific", "description": "<p>The OWASP Victoria chapter is pleased to present our first<br/>event since OWASP BC Day.
