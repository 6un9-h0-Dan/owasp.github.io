Announcements</p> <p>2. Kubernetes Security 101: Best Practices to Secure your Cluster</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>This talk aims to give an overview about how Kubernetes works to and provide some best practices to secure your cluster whenever your are deploying a new cluster on your own or via managed services such as GKE, EKS or AKS. We are going to cover everything from the Control Plane or the Master Node, starting with the API server, including etcd, RBAC and network policies. Then, we\u2019ll cover the worker nodes, kubelet, audit logs and pods best practices. We'll talk about the CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes and the default configurations you need to worry about when deploying a new cluster. We'll show how to use RBAC and assign roles and permissions to your cluster users. We'll demonstrate how to enable audit logs for better visibility and later we'll set up some network policies to avoid communication between pods and prevent any lateral movement from attackers.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Magno (Logan) Rodrigues is an Information Security Specialist at Trend Micro currently focusing on Container and Cloud Security.

Keys Under Doormats: Problems and Solutions for Storing Credentials in Web Applications Securely</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Encryption keys and passwords are truly \"keys to the kingdom.\" Acquiring them allows attacker to open all kinds of doors, and yet developers are often careless about how they handle them. We often see password and keys hardcoded in the application source, stored with minimal obfuscation in configuration files, and in plaintext in databases. As a result they fall victim to reverse engineering, and software vulnerabilities such as Path Traversal, XXE, Local File Inclusion, and others.</p> <p>To help mitigate that we review right and wrong ways of storing credentials in an application, and discuss best practices for storing them, such as using keystores.</p> <p>Once your secrets are properly secured, however, there is a big remaining issue - how do you secure the \"key that secures other keys\", the Key Encrypting Key (KEK)? Would it not be vulnerable to the same issues we just tried to solve with keys and passwords? In our presentation we discuss preferred ways for securely storing KEKs, from hardware to software, and their relative costs. We conclude by proposing several low cost ways for storing KEKs that any application can afford to implement and offer an open source library that helps achieve that.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dmitriy is a Senior Security Researcher at Vectra AI.

Why? Because they are full of security flaws! From your online banking to your IOT fridge and your government agency, are full of actually quite simple bugs. Now I'm a Bug Bounty hunter, I love a good- er bad API, with impactful bugs.</p> <p>In this demo I'll take you through how to hack an API and show you real security flaws in organisations, some of which I've found personally, in products you've heard of! We'll cover IDORs/BOLAs, information disclosure, account takeovers, injection + more! Showing how even the simplest of software issues, a missing if statement, can snowball into a major security breach. This is an interactive session and I'll be asking the audience to help give me ideas on how to approach the API!</p> <p>-- Stream: TBD.<br/>-- Chat: #chapter-santa-barbara channel on <a href=\"https://owasp.slack.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://owasp.slack.com/</a>.

Building security into the software development and management practices of a company can be a daunting task. There are many elements to the equation: company structure, different stakeholders, technology stacks, tools and processes, and so forth. Implementing software assurance will have a significant impact on the organization. Yet, trying to achieve this without a good framework is most likely leading to just marginal and unsustainable improvements. OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) gives you a structural and measurable framework to do just that. It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organization. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices.<br/>We will cover a number of topics in the talk: (i) the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, (ii) the measurement model which was set up to cover both coverage and quality and (iii) the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example DevOps team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Brian Glas has worked in IT for 20 years and information/application security for the last fifteen.
