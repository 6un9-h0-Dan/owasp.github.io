He started the Belgian OWASP chapter, was a member of the OWASP Foundation Board and performed several public presentations on Application Security. Seba also co-founded the yearly security &amp; hacker BruCON conference and trainings in Belgium. With a background in development and many years of experience in security, he has trained countless developers to create software more securely. He has led OWASP projects such as OWASP SAMM, thereby truly making the world a little bit safer. Now he is adapting application security models to the evolving field of DevOps and is also focused on bringing Threat Modeling to a wider audience.</p> <p>Desription</p> <p>OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices. We will cover a number of topics in the talk:<br/>the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, the measurement model which was setup to cover both coverage and quality and the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example development team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Ottawa", "repo": "www-chapter-ottawa", "name": "OWASP Ottawa: January 2021 Meetup", "date": "2021-01-20", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Ottawa/events/275540224/", "timezone": "Canada/Eastern", "description": "<p>Special Notice:</p> <p>Due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic our events will continue online on our YouTube channel.</p> <p>Subscribe to our YouTube channel, set a reminder and you\u2019ll get a notification as soon as we go live!</p> <p>We will post information here and on all our other medias (email, twitter etc.) as we are closer to the date.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tiOc1OO2PI\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tiOc1OO2PI</a></p> <p>7:00 EDT PM: Technical Talks</p> <p>1.

Dr. Josephson obtained a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology from the University of Ottawa in 2004. Prior to this, he worked both internationally and in the Federal Government and as such he brings to his interactions with clients his experience and knowledge from working cross-culturally and in the culture of the Federal Government.</p> <p>Dr. Josephson provides psychotherapy and assessment services to adults experiencing a variety of challenges such as: anxiety, depression, stress, anger, relationship difficulties, career concerns and adjustment to major life changes (including injury and illness).</p> <p>Dr. Josephson has a longstanding interest in Health Psychology and in the role of Psychology in not only treating but preventing physical and mental health problems; particularly through assisting people to better understand and increase their motivation for emotional and physical self-care/fitness.</p> <p>3. Measurement &amp; Reporting for Appsec &amp; Vulnerability Management</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Intelligent metrics can help you get other people to do things they might not otherwise do, get your team to do things better (and understand what better means), show success towards objectives, and predict or plan for the future. Join Opheliar Chan as she shares her experiences building metrics to support application security and vulnerability management programs.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Opheliar Chan spends most of her time trying to make software security more accessible, pragmatic, and FUD-free, both as Director of Advisory at Security Compass, while moonlighting as co-lead of the OWASP Toronto Chapter, or as a volunteer or advisor for other infosec groups. For over a decade, she has focused on application security, SDLC process consulting and implementations, program building, penetration testing/vulnerability assessments, and related.

The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model and the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which are presented in the talk, show security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.</p> <p>In this session Timo will give an introduction and answers questions like when to use OWASP SAMM and when and how to use DSOMM.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Timo has been in the IT industry for over twenty years. After being a system administrator and web developer in his early times, he became involved in OWASP.

If you are unable to find a team, let us know and we will help form a team for you.</p> <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers.

Building security into the software development and management practices of a company can be a daunting task. There are many elements to the equation: company structure, different stakeholders, technology stacks, tools and processes, and so forth. Implementing software assurance will have a significant impact on the organization. Yet, trying to achieve this without a good framework is most likely leading to just marginal and unsustainable improvements. OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) gives you a structural and measurable framework to do just that. It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organization. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices.<br/>We will cover a number of topics in the talk: (i) the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, (ii) the measurement model which was set up to cover both coverage and quality and (iii) the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example DevOps team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.<br/>Bio: Brian Glas has worked in IT for almost 20 years and information/application security for the last decade. He started as an enterprise Java developer, then transitioned to helping build an application security program as both tech lead and manager. He later played the role of enterprise architect and did a little incident response and reverse engineering malware for fun.

While security products can help to mitigate certain risks as an additional defense line, API developers have the ultimate responsibility for their code and must know the risks to avoid them.</p> <p>This will be an online live event (link will be added before the event).</p> <p>Speaker Biodata of Mr. Md Jahangir Alam:<br/>Md Jahangir Alam is the leader of the OWASP Dhaka Chapter.

Zero Trust makes attackers' lives hard! You'll leave this talk with three main takeaways: 1) Why Zero Trust design is so important for web application design. 2) A phased approach you can take with your old and new projects. 3) Learn about a simple, secure, scalable Zero Trust reference design you can implement using Okta and Cloudflare (and see a demo!).</p> <p>Biography: Michael is a senior member of BCI's Cyber Security Engineering team and a champion of Zero Trust designs. Michael's own cybersecurity research has discovered and reported security vulnerabilities involving the US Department of Homeland Security's ICS CERT, ICS/SCADA vendors, Defence Research and Development Canada and hardware/software vendors.</p> "}]
