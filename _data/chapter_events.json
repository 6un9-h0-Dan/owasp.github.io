Inspired by Hack the Box's King of the Hill, every second month, we are bringing you a night of hacking, to unleash your skills on a series of vulnerable machines, then defend against your opponents! This will be a team-based event where you are free to choose your own teams (minimum of 2 members and maximum of 4). If you are unable to find a team, let us know and we will help form a team for you.</p> <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers. The second rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers. Other than that, all attack vectors within the given IP range are allowed. This includes Denial of Service, Man-in-the-Middle, and any other attack methods you can think of that are usually banned from CTFs!</p> <p>Challenges will be of varying difficulties but the idea is the same -- break into a machine, plant your team's flag, then defend your machine(s) from other teams who will be trying to plant their own flag. The team whose flag is present once the time limit is up claims the points for that machine.</p> <p>At the end of the year, the top team from each Fight Club night will go head to head in our grand finale at BSides Sydney!</p> <p>To register please go to: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Ukb1gTZZLR7SALHA6\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/Ukb1gTZZLR7SALHA6</a></p> <p>Don't miss out on this opportunity to be crowned fight club champion!</p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<br/>OWASP Sydney does not guarantee that the ENVIRONMENT or any other associated website or servers, through which the content is made available to the Users, are provided without any \u201cvirus\u201d or harmful component.
