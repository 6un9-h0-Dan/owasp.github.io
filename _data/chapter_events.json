MPC has been studied for several decades, which has led to many different protocols with multiple security-performance trade-offs, as well as a large knowledge base on the theoretical limits of this technology.</p> <p>It is natural to expect something as powerful and general as MPC to be overly complicated and hard to grasp. However, it turns out that many of the core ideas used in MPC are not really that complex, and one can get a fairly solid understanding of the field by learning these concepts. The goal of this talk is to introduce the audience to what MPC is, present some basic terminology, and discuss some essential results and constructions that serve as the basis for many other practically-oriented protocols. In a bit more detail, the talk will start by introducing some essential concepts in MPC like honest and dishonest majority or passive and active security, then we will discuss what is known to be achievable and what is known to be impossible, and proceed to present some basic constructions based on additive and Shamir secret-sharing.</p> <p>---<br/>Presenter: Daniel Escudero (<a href=\"https://deescuderoo.github.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://deescuderoo.github.io</a>)</p> <p>I'm a last year PhD student at Aarhus University, Denmark, working under the supervision of Ivan Damg\u00e5rd. My background is in Mathematics, and my current interests are the different interactions between these and Cryptography, specially when it comes to performing computation on 'hidden' data. I am also interested in the applicability of these techniques to different real-world challenges. I also enjoy knowledge dissemination, and I am a strong believer of the existing value in making seemingly complex idea simple.</p> <p>---<br/>Co-hosted with Cryptography Meetup: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cryptography-Meetup\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Cryptography-Meetup</a></p> <p>The goal of the Cryptography Meetup is to make cryptography more approachable for programmers.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a programmer looking to explore, understand and build systems that use cryptographic algorithms, come learn with us.

At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.live web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic\u2019s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019. You should totally ask him for video game recommendations after the talk.</p> <p>Yoann Padioleau is a software engineer at r2c, and the main author of Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. Previously, Yoann started the AppSec, Test Engineering, and Program Analysis teams at Facebook, where he created many tools for software developers, including an ancestor of Semgrep for PHP. Before that, he was doing research in academia with a focus on developer tools. He co-created Coccinelle in 2008 with Julia Lawall, which is also an ancestor of Semgrep for C. Yoann received his PhD in Computer Science at INRIA Rennes in France.

This talk will focus on<br/>using OSINT to find information about people. This can be a useful skill<br/>when trying to track a malicious user from email address to home<br/>address.

She has been in IT for over 8 years and worked in both<br/>government and corporate environments before joining higher ed. Prior to her career in Information Security she worked in Business to Business<br/>sales where OSINT and Social Engineering skills were vital to creating<br/>sales leads and closing deals. She carried this knowledge with her into<br/>Information Security and it helps her better educate end users on their<br/>vulnerability to social engineering attacks.
