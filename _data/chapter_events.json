He started the Belgian OWASP chapter, was a member of the OWASP Foundation Board and performed several public presentations on Application Security. Seba also co-founded the yearly security &amp; hacker BruCON conference and trainings in Belgium. With a background in development and many years of experience in security, he has trained countless developers to create software more securely. He has led OWASP projects such as OWASP SAMM, thereby truly making the world a little bit safer. Now he is adapting application security models to the evolving field of DevOps and is also focused on bringing Threat Modeling to a wider audience.</p> <p>Desription</p> <p>OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices. We will cover a number of topics in the talk:<br/>the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, the measurement model which was setup to cover both coverage and quality and the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will demonstrate the new SAMM2 toolbox to measure the maturity of an example development team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Oklahoma City", "repo": "www-chapter-oklahoma-city", "name": "Web Application Vulnerability Testing", "date": "2021-01-29", "time": "15:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Oklahoma-City-Chapter-Meetup/events/275799003/", "timezone": "US/Central", "description": "<p>I\u2019m this meeting we are going to cover how to identify and test for 3 web application vulnerabilities.</p> <p>The presenters will be:</p> <p>1.

Inspired by Hack the Box's King of the Hill, every second month, we are bringing you a night of hacking, to unleash your skills on a series of vulnerable machines, then defend against your opponents! This will be a team-based event where you are free to choose your own teams (minimum of 2 members and maximum of 4). If you are unable to find a team, let us know and we will help form a team for you.</p> <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers. The second rule of Fight Club is: no attacking other participants' personal computers. Other than that, all attack vectors within the given IP range are allowed. This includes Denial of Service, Man-in-the-Middle, and any other attack methods you can think of that are usually banned from CTFs!</p> <p>Challenges will be of varying difficulties but the idea is the same -- break into a machine, plant your team's flag, then defend your machine(s) from other teams who will be trying to plant their own flag. The team whose flag is present once the time limit is up claims the points for that machine.</p> <p>At the end of the year, the top team from each Fight Club night will go head to head in our grand finale at BSides Sydney!</p> <p>To register please go to: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Ukb1gTZZLR7SALHA6\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/Ukb1gTZZLR7SALHA6</a></p> <p>Don't miss out on this opportunity to be crowned fight club champion!</p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<br/>OWASP Sydney does not guarantee that the ENVIRONMENT or any other associated website or servers, through which the content is made available to the Users, are provided without any \u201cvirus\u201d or harmful component.

In this position he is responsible for overseeing PCI Forensic Investigations and Incident Response; addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.</p> <p>Prior to this appointment, Keith was the Technical Director at CYFOR for 15 years where he was responsible for directing all digital forensic operations within the company; providing specialist knowledge of information technology investigative techniques and dealing with complex evidential and legal issues, instructing investigating officers and counsel as appropriate; ensuring evidence continuity, evidential integrity and admissibility of any recovered evidence in a manner acceptable to a Court of Law.</p> <p>Keith\u2019s exemplary career includes 22 years in the Royal Air Force Police specialising as a Counterintelligence and Information Technology Security investigator.

All of these have two major things in common; seamless connectivity and huge data transfer. This also results in plenty of additional opportunities for significant data breaches and associated cyber security threats. The objective of traditional digital forensics is to identify, collect, analyse, and present digital evidence, collected from various mediums, in a cyber related incident; the exponential growth of IoT devices and the increasing number of cyber security incidents has given birth to the term IoT forensics and the resulting challenges. Additionally, most IoT devices come with no inbuilt security features and there is a requirement for more research into IoT devices security, IoT forensic readiness, and a forensic framework for IoT device.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "}, {"chapter": "Switzerland", "repo": "www-chapter-switzerland", "name": "ZAP Automation in CI/CD", "date": "2021-02-09", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/275004625/", "timezone": "Europe/Zurich", "description": "<p>OWASP ZAP is probably the most frequently used web application scanner in the world, and automation is one of its strengths.<br/>In this talk Simon will explain the different options you have for running ZAP in a CI/CD pipeline ranging from the packaged scans to directly driving the ZAP API.<br/>He will also explain (and maybe even demo) a new ZAP automation framework which is currently under development.</p> <p>ZAP is an OWASP flagship project and you can find more information on <a href=\"https://www.zaproxy.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.zaproxy.org/</a> .</p> <p>About your speaker:<br/>Simon Bennetts is the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Project Leader and a Distinguished Engineer at StackHawk, a company that uses ZAP to help users fix application security bugs before they hit production.<br/>He has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA &amp; AsiaPac.<br/>Prior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years and strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.</p> "}]
