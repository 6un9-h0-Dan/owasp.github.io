The presentation is based on a TEDex talk of Ernesto Sirolli where he talks about his experiences as aid-work volunteer in the 70s and what he learned from it.</p> <p>Where he commented on a failure as \"at least we fed the hippos\".</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>The security community is trying to solve insecurity caused by bugs and flaws in software for many years now, but with what success?<br/>We almost never look at successes and failures experiences in other areas, but we could really learn from them. This talk is inspired by Ernesto Sirolli\u2019s TED talk \u201cWant to help someone? Shut up and listen!\u201d about failures in aid programs around the world. Listening to Ernesto Sirolli, you cannot miss the similarity with the security community trying to tell developers how to write secure code. This talk points out common failures of the security community when communicating with developers, trying to solve their problems without understanding what their problems really are.<br/>Using the hippo-analogy for resource wasted and security failures. During the talks, those \u2018(in-)secure hippos\u2019 are identified, advice on how to avoid them are provided, by anecdotes and best practices from the perience of the past 15 years in the security field of information / application security.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Martin Knobloch, Global AppSec Strategist at Micro Focus, is a long-time information security leader with more than 15 years of experience in the field.

Simply put if Cyber is in the business of Revenue Protection, then we need to have a defense in depth plan to combat the biggest threats to our companies. This matrix allows a company to overlay their major threats with the NIST Cyber Security Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, &amp; Recover) to build a robust security plan. Organizations which perform this activity will gain a better understanding of how to protect their company as they fill in safeguards which mitigate important threats. Remember the devil is in the details, hence why we chose a TaSManian Devil as the project logo.</p> <p>Ross Young is the CISO of Caterpillar Financial, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, and a SANS instructor. Prior to this role, he was a divisional CISO at Capital One. His expertise ranges from attacking financial services for the federal government to defending organizations by automating defenses in DevSecOps pipelines. He is actively involved in all things cloud, container, and Kubernetes security. Ross holds master's and bachelor's degrees from Johns Hopkins University, Idaho State University, and Utah State University.

This talk is for those people as well as for people who are considering taking a long term hiatus for personal reasons. In this talk they will find advice on how to stay relevant during their time off and then return to their professional careers with marketable skills and a new perspective. Special emphasis is on security careers, whether the attendees are already in a security-related roles or want to re-career into them.</p> <p>In this COVID-19 era, we need to build a new perspective for the new normal. Careers are radically changing due to the pandemic and we need to adapt. Some industries and companies are thriving; others are on the decline. The most important advice we can give is that you should have a plan for your hiatus that leaves you at the base step of a new career once you are ready to return to work.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Lori joined her first Internet startup as a senior system administrator. When that company went public, she was hooked, and helping smaller firms prevail against well established rivals has been her passion ever since.

As you may know, I was elected to the OWASP Global Board of Directors and am serving as the Secretary for 2021. In addition, I also volunteer as the Nashua Chapter Leader, and I am on the 2021 Training Planning Committee, and I am on the Compliance Committee, and I am on the Trademark Board Committee, and I am on the Policy Review Committee.</p> <p>That's a lot of volunteering and I need some help.</p> <p>Chapters are now required to have at least two leaders, so I need at least one more of you to step up as a chapter leader for Nashua (we can have a max of five I believe). The role entails setting up meetings and finding speakers for them. Pretty easy stuff! As a Chapter Leader, you'll get discounts on OWASP events. If I can't get one more person to volunteer as a Chapter Leader, then OWASP will shut down our chapter.</p> <p>Next, for OWASP global events, we are always looking for reviewers of submissions. We get people who want to give talks and trainings at our events and as a reviewer, you would be asked to read their proposal and score it. It takes roughly 10 minutes per submission. In return, you get a discount on the event. Drop me a line if you're interested in doing this in the future and I'll add you to the list.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing all of you, and especially those of you that have recently joined.</p> <p>You can reach out to me directly with any questions: bil.corry@owasp.org</p> <p>Best regards,</p> <p>- Bil</p> "}, {"chapter": "Karachi", "repo": "www-chapter-karachi", "name": "OWASP Mobile App Sec", "date": "2021-02-27", "time": "19:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Karachi-Chapter/events/276516990/", "timezone": "Asia/Karachi", "description": "<p>As mobile apps are becoming popular these days, we would love to bring one session on Mobile App Sec.

During this period, we managed to revive Slovenian part of OWASP and even applied and got accepted our first OWASP project. SecureBank is deliberately broken bank with all of OWASP TOP 10 mistakes. Written in .Net Core and with full access to the source code. How did we do it, what stood in our way and how it can help you will be main topic of our presentation.</p> <p>Bios:<br/>Milan Gabor is OWASP freak with long history of breaking all kind of applications, systems and people. He enjoys playing with all sort of security related topics and dreams about paragliding.</p> <p>Gregor Spagnolo is a g33k who loves to break all kinds of stuff. He is a passionate developer but even more passionate breaker. He has extensive knowledge in secure application development and lifecycle.</p> <p>----------</p> <p>Vanja Svajcer: SolarWinds compromise - lessons learned</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Supply chain attacks have a reputation for being difficult to execute for both attackers and defenders. They are typically attributed to top level actor groups and are reserved for attacking only the highest profile targets.</p> <p>SolarWinds compromise at the end of 2020 displayed full potential of supply chain attacks, with the complex attack chain starting with the compromised SolarWinds Orion build process, including malicious source code injection, implanted backdoor, C2 DGA based communication protocol and secondary payload implementation.</p> <p>In this session we will look at the details of the compromise and describe attackers's TTPs keeping in mind they have not been discovered for more than half a year after the initial compromise. We will conclude with a list of items red and blue team members could have learned from it and propose steps that can be implemented to prevent and detect similar attacks.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Vanja Svajcer works as a Threat researcher for Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence organisation.</p> <p>Vanja enjoys tinkering with automated analysis systems, reversing binaries and Android malware. He thinks time spent scraping telemetry data for signs of new attacks is well worth the effort.</p> <p>In his free time, he is trying to improve on his piano and guitar playing skills and often plays basketball, which at his age is not a recommended activity.</p> "}]
