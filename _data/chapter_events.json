This talk is inspired by Ernesto Sirolli\u2019s TED talk \u201cWant to help someone? Shut up and listen!\u201d about failures in aid programs around the world. Listening to Ernesto Sirolli, you cannot miss the similarity with the security community trying to tell developers how to write secure code. This talk points out common failures of the security community when communicating with developers, trying to solve their problems without understanding what their problems really are.<br/>Using the hippo-analogy for resource wasted and security failures. During the talks, those \u2018(in-)secure hippos\u2019 are identified, advice on how to avoid them are provided, by anecdotes and best practices from the perience of the past 15 years in the security field of information / application security.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Martin Knobloch, Global AppSec Strategist at Micro Focus, is a long-time information security leader with more than 15 years of experience in the field.

While integrating security into CI/CD offers many benefits, it is critical to understand that a full SSA program encompasses a variety of activities \u2013 many of which are incompatible with run time restrictions and other constraints imposed by these pipelines. This webinar looks at the breadth of activities involved in a mature SSA program and steps through the aspects of a program that can be realistically included in a pipeline, as well as those that cannot. It also reviews how these activities and related tooling have evolved over time as the application security discipline has matured and as development teams started to focus on cloud-native development techniques and technologies.<br/>Speaker:</p> <p>Dan Cornell<br/>A globally recognized application security expert, Dan Cornell holds over 15 years of experience architecting, developing and securing web-based software systems.
