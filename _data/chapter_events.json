By the time controls are put in place to thwart the technical IOCs, attackers change it and counter with new attacks. So, it becomes essential for defenders to continuously automate the Threat Intelligence actioning and harness the tactical information as well used by attackers and have countermeasures in place.</p> <p>By automating Threat Intel collection, analysis, and dissemination, we can deduce predictive intelligence providing greater visibility to the organizations while allowing them to anticipate and counter threats even before they attack. We will discuss how end-to-end threat intelligence automation in a closed trusted sharing environment could be used to operationalize actionable and relevant predictive intelligence by correlating, enriching, and analyzing threat data collected in real-time from a wide range of external and internal sources over a hub and spoke sharing model. We will also cover advanced automation strategies for the full threat intelligence lifecycle while detailing how mutual threat sightings could be used to identify and prioritize threats with precision confidence.</p> <p>High Level Agenda for Presentation</p> <p>Collective Defense Vs Passive Defense Vs Active Defense</p> <p>Threat Intelligence and Its types</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Operationalisation</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Automation / Orchestration</p> <p>Threat Intelligence Collaboration</p> <p>Collective Defense</p> <p>Takeaways</p> <p>---<br/>Short bio :<br/>Avkash K<br/>VP - Research and Innovation at Cyware Labs</p> <p>Information Security professional with overall 12+ years of experience in Information Security domain.

This talk will provide important insights into understanding the differences between on-prem and cloud security, including the shared responsibility model. Then we will review architecting and securing systems in AWS and an explanation of concepts such as accounts, regions, AZs, VPCs, subgroups, NACLs, etc. We will discuss encryption including KMS and HSM. We'll also review AWS-provided security or related tools such as AWS Inspector, GuardDuty, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, etc. Finally, we'll discuss some best practices and recommendations that have been obtained from running large workloads in AWS.</p> <p>Speaker's Bio: Rohini Sulatycki is an experienced security architect who has setup Application Security programs and is considered an AppSec Innovator. She specializes in architecture, with strong background and skills in multiple areas of security, including cloud security, telecom security, application &amp; mobile penetration testing.

Jorge Flores, Security Analyst III at Arthex</p> <p>Title: Pass Your Security Certification Exam in One Try</p> <p>Abstract: Information Security certifications have become important in recent times. For one, the right certification serves as a third-party validation of your skills/knowledge. For another, certain organizations require specific certification(s) for employment. However, security certification exams can be difficult and challenging test for many reasons, especially if you are a weak test taker. In this session we discuss our journeys and experiences using CISSP as an example and how we were able to pass it. We'll discuss tips, tools, and training programs that helped us pass the challenging exam.</p> <p>Speaker\u2019s Bio: Stephanie Thomaston is a military veteran with 10+ years\u2019 service in both the United States Navy &amp; Air Force Reserves.

It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organization. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM v2 model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today\u2019s development practices. We will cover the core structure of the model, which was redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices, and the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. We will also talk about how SAMM is currently being incorporated into the RABET-V project from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) in collaboration with the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to provide a verification standard for non-voting software. RABET-V is a flexible, risk-based, and cost-effective election system verification process that will expedite verification of non-voting election systems while providing assurances of security, reliability, and usability.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Brian Glas has worked in IT for 20 years and Information/Application Security for the 15 years. He started as an enterprise Java developer, then transitioned to helping build an application security program as both tech lead and manager. He later played the role of enterprise architect and did a little incident response and reverse engineering malware for fun. Glas then spent several years as a consultant helping clients build AppSec programs, create/update SDLCs, and other related initiatives. He has worked on the Trustworthy Computing team at Microsoft and is now an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Union University authoring a Cybersecurity program. He also has been a co-lead for SAMM v1.1-2.0 and the OWASP Top 10 for several years.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Boulder", "repo": "www-chapter-boulder", "name": "Join us (virtually) for Denver/Boulder OWASP's September Meeting!!!", "date": "2020-09-16", "time": "17:30", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Boulder/events/273011214/", "timezone": "US/Mountain", "description": "<p>Topic: Account Takeover: Data Findings, Popular Tools, and Prevalent Actors</p> <p>In our latest account takeover (ATO) findings, we have observed a significant increase in credentials listed on the deep and dark web (15 billion and counting), tools that enable account takeover, and account takeover service advertisements on criminal marketplaces.
