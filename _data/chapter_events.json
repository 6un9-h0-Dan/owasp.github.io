MPC has been studied for several decades, which has led to many different protocols with multiple security-performance trade-offs, as well as a large knowledge base on the theoretical limits of this technology.</p> <p>It is natural to expect something as powerful and general as MPC to be overly complicated and hard to grasp. However, it turns out that many of the core ideas used in MPC are not really that complex, and one can get a fairly solid understanding of the field by learning these concepts. The goal of this talk is to introduce the audience to what MPC is, present some basic terminology, and discuss some essential results and constructions that serve as the basis for many other practically-oriented protocols. In a bit more detail, the talk will start by introducing some essential concepts in MPC like honest and dishonest majority or passive and active security, then we will discuss what is known to be achievable and what is known to be impossible, and proceed to present some basic constructions based on additive and Shamir secret-sharing.</p> <p>---<br/>Presenter: Daniel Escudero (<a href=\"https://deescuderoo.github.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://deescuderoo.github.io</a>)</p> <p>I'm a last year PhD student at Aarhus University, Denmark, working under the supervision of Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.

It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for TS, TS/React, Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c.</p> <p>Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.</p> <p>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Or find hardcoded credentials using the query:<br/>boto3.client(..., aws_secret_access_key=\u201d...\u201d, aws_access_key_id=\u201d...\u201d )</p> <p>Duration: 45' talk/workshop + QA + chatting<br/>Language: EN</p> <p>###Moderated by</p> <p>P\u00e9ter Nyilasy on behalf of OWASP HU</p> <p>### Speakers</p> <p>Bence Nagy is a software engineer at r2c, working on Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.live web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic\u2019s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019. You should totally ask him for video game recommendations after the talk.</p> <p>Yoann Padioleau is a software engineer at r2c, and the main author of Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. Previously, Yoann started the AppSec, Test Engineering, and Program Analysis teams at Facebook, where he created many tools for software developers, including an ancestor of Semgrep for PHP. Before that, he was doing research in academia with a focus on developer tools. He co-created Coccinelle in 2008 with Julia Lawall, which is also an ancestor of Semgrep for C. Yoann received his PhD in Computer Science at INRIA Rennes in France.
