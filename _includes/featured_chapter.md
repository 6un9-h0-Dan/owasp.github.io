One of our oldest and most active chapters, the Bay Area is host to three local OWASP chapters north, east and south bay. North Bay meets in the city monthly and often draws both startups and established Silicon Valley icons to their meetings. Last month their meeting was hosted at Mozillaâ€™s event space at Embarcadero where the security team from Salesforce shared learnings on testing.
