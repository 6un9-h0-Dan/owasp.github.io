The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering for the iOS and Android platform, describing technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the MSTG's co-project Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS). The MASVS defines a mobile app security model and lists generic security requirements for mobile apps while the MSTG serves as a baseline for manual security testing and as a template for automated security tests during or after development. Included with the MSTG, the Mobile Security Hacking Playground is a collection of iOS and Android mobile apps, that are intentionally built insecure. These apps are used as examples to demonstrate different vulnerabilities explained in the MSTG. [Learn more](https://owasp.org/mstg "MSTG Project Site") about the MSTG and the MASVS.
