The [OWASP Security Knowledge Framework (SKF)](/www-project-security-knowledge-framework/) is a fully open-source Python-Flask web application that uses the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard to train developers in writing secure code, by design. The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is incredibly relevant to current application security and should be required in any organization for training developers, security researchers, and even gathering requirements.

SKF helps and empowers developers to give them the right awareness and knowledge to build secure applications. Everything is ready and able to be deployed in Kubernetes platforms as well as being available via docker-compose and bare-metal/on-premise deployments.
